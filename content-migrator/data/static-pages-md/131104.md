### Workshop Goals & Agenda:

This 1 ½ day hands-on workshop brings together researchers and practitioners interested in the scientific development, update, and usage of science maps and their alignment with existing science, engineering, and education classifications and taxonomies. Specifically, participants will discuss the update and extension of the UCSD Map of Science and Classification System to cover recent publication data by Elsevier’s Scopus and Thomson Reuters’ Web of Science as well as Chinese data and data from SciELO. In addition, the workshop will discuss scientifically sound standards for aligning existing science maps to each other and to major other classification systems. Last but not least, funding opportunities and strategic alliances will be discussed.
