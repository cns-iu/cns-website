### **Workshop Goals & Agenda:**

This 1 ½ day workshop brings together science map makers, researchers and the media to invigorate the public discussion and appreciation of science, research and the metrics that make it understandable to all. Demonstration of existing approaches, tools, and techniques as well as discussion of synergies, will provide a point of departure for developing ideas about the future and practicality of broadcasting science and technology forecasts for public consumption.  
  
Given the diverse backgrounds of the participants and the goals of the workshop, we will use the first ½ day for brief self-introductions, followed by three 30 min overview talks that set the stage for the workshop. The day concludes with a discussion of challenges and opportunities and a shared dinner. The second full day features brainstorming and discussion sessions in different team sizes and combinations.
