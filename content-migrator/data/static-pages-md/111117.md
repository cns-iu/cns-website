Director, [Cyberinfrastructure for Network Science Center](deadlink.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcns.slis.indiana.edu%2F); Curator, [Places & Spaces: Mapping Science](http://scimaps.org) exhibit, [katy@iu.edu](mailto:katy@iu.edu)

### **Workshop Goals & Agenda:**

The workshop brings together leading experts in the design, prototyping, and evaluation of travelling science exhibit with science map makers to elaborate the recent "Full-Scale Development: Anyone Can Map: Charting and Exploring the History and Future of Science and Technology" preproposal for resubmission as an 2-year $250,000 ISE Pathway project. Detailed learning objectives and associated exhibit activities, e.g.,

*   'turn on/off' different data streams and tell which one is most massive/overpowering
*   take one data set and plot it as timeline, scatter plot, or overlaid on a geo and topic map. What different insights are gained?
*   explore networks - start with a table, extract a network, analyze and visualize it (see slides 61-66 in http://ivl.cns.iu.edu/km/pres/2011-borner-sci2tutorial-nsf.pdf). Identify clusters and backbones so that they can be prototyped and tested with children to substantiate a follow-up full proposal.

  

We might like to identify preliminary studies that help demonstrate children's interest in mapping/seeing/understanding their (social) networks, envision possible career trajectories, experience battles for owning intellectual space via patents, etc. We could decide to ask 8-10 year olds to pick their top-n from the set of 20 possible learning objectives/exhibits. I truly believe my 9 and 12 year old daughters would love to climb data mountains, slide down and follow the trajectories of merging and diverging information flows (virtually?), puzzle together their own family network/the family/collaboration networks of famous scientists, or open/close 'data pipes' to see what data pours out of them into/onto different base maps (scatter, geo, topic maps).
