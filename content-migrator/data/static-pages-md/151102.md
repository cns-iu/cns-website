### **Workshop Goals & Agenda:**

This 1.5 day, invitation-only workshop will bring together healthcare and public health professionals, biomedical informaticians, visualization and data analytics experts, and developers. The overall theme is to advance the use of big data analytics and visualization for population health monitoring and management. Key goals of the workshop are to:

*   conceptualize key approaches to assessing data quality in large healthcare databases using analytics and visualizations;
*   monitor real-time data streams with regard to volume, type of data and data quality;
*   identify use cases for the application of discussed approaches to population health monitoring and management; and
*   discuss synergies among efforts and possible joint funding applications.

Format is a combination brief presentations, brainstorming sessions, and hands-on sessions--to be finalized when participants are confirmed.
