### Tuesday, November 4, 4:00-6:00 pm  
[Slides](http://cns.iu.edu/images/openhouses/2014/2014-OH.pdf)

Each year, we invite our friends and colleagues to join us for two hours of enlightening talks, hands-on demos, snacks, and drinks. We work hard to make our open house a fun and educational soirée where guests are free to roam about, explore our visualizations, and of course ask questions!  
  
This year's open house will be held at the Social Science Research Commons (SSRC) in Woodburn Hall, near the intersection of E. 7th St. and N. Forrest Ave.  
  
If you're unable to attend the open house in person, we will be streaming it live. [**Click here around 4:00 pm on November 4 to access the live stream**.](deadlink.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiana.edu%2F~video%2Fstream%2Fliveflash.html%3Ffilename%3DCNS_Open_House)

[VISUALIZATIONS](http://cns.iu.edu/visualizations)
--------------------------------------------------

![bbsrc_screenshot.jpg](http://cns.iu.edu/images/openhouses/2014/bbsrc_screenshot.jpg)

### BBSRC Grant Visualizer

At the end of 2013, CNS delivered an online research funding visualizer for the United Kingdom's [Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)](http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/home/home.aspx?utm_source=April+2014&utm_campaign=April+10%2C+2014&utm_medium=email "BBSRC").  
  
BBSRC (based in Swindon, England) has a unique and central place in supporting the UK's world-leading position in bioscience. With a budget of £467M in 2012-13, the council is a major investor in research and training. Their goals are to further scientific knowledge, to promote economic growth, wealth, and job creation, and to improve the quality of life in the UK and beyond.  
  
The new web-based interface is designed to allow BBSRC research managers to visualize their portfolio across specific topics, universities, and other research organizations' funding mechanisms. They can visualize the data year-by-year, or as an animation of funding allocations over time.  
  
The front end of the application takes advantage of jQuery and the D3.js Javascript library, which was used to iterate through the datasets and render high-quality SVG graphs. Our approach allowed us to provide a unified experience across most browsers, and the use of SVG and intelligent styling allow for scaling to almost any screen size.

  
  
![NETE_screenshot2.jpg](http://cns.iu.edu/images/openhouses/2014/NETE_screenshot2.jpg)

### NETE A/V Tool

In August 2014, our development team finished an NIH-funded SBIR Phase II project that resulted in a major overhaul of the NETE Analyzer/Visualizer, a web-based data visualization tool originally developed in 2012 and used by NIH program officers.  
  
The all-new responsive interface scales effortlessly from desktop to tablet browsing and boasts several new features aimed at optimizing a variety of visualization types for effective communication of the insights inherent in the data.  
  
It is highly interactive, empowering users to pinch-zoom and pan, search and filter, and click individual nodes to access detailed information. A full-screen option and hide-and-show legend window have been added to give users the cleanest and largest possible view of their data.  
  
The project effectively converts existing Sci2 tool visualizations such as temporal bar graphs, geospatial maps, science maps, and network visualizations into online web services. In the second year, two new visualizations will be added.

[HUMANEXUS RECEIVES ACCOLADES](http://cns.iu.edu/humanexus)
-----------------------------------------------------------

[![Humanexus_DVDInsert.png](https://cns.iu.edu/images/openhouses/2014/Humanexus_DVDInsert.png)](http://cns.iu.edu/humanexus)_Humanexus: Knowledge and Communication through the Ages_ is the product of a close collaboration between animator Ying-Fang Shen, Katy Börner, and composer and sound designer Norbert Herber, a senior lecturer in Indiana University’s Department of Telecommunications. The film tracks the evolution of human communication from cave scrawls to Twitter feeds, offering a unique depiction of the ever-accelerating spread of information and communication over the course of human history.  
  
The film has garnered worldwide acclaim since its release in 2013, most recently winning the Audience Award at the 2014 Short@ Fringe at Azores Fringe Festival in Azores, Portugal, the Award of Merit at theWorld Film Awards in Jakarta, Indonesia, and Third Prize at the Aviff Cannes Art Film Festival in Cannes, France. See the impressive full list of awards [here](http://cns.iu.edu/humanexus "Humanexus Awards"). Such accolades serve as testimony to both the relevance of the film’s message and the artistic vision through which Shen conveys that message.

[![UMpr090404-011.jpg](http://cns.iu.edu/images/openhouses/2014/UMpr090404-011.jpg)](deadlink.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscimaps.org%2Fmiami)

For the first time ever all 100 maps are on display as the 10-year [_Places & Spaces_](http://scimaps.org) journey culminates with a beautiful array at the University of Miami. The ten new maps continue the exhibit’s commitment to bringing audiences the most stunning and groundbreaking examples of data visualization from the most brilliant mapmakers of our time.  
  
Half of the 100 visualizations are displayed at the Stanley and Jewell Glasgow Hall in the [Perez Architecture Center](deadlink.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Farc.miami.edu%2Fthe-school%2Ffacilities%2Fperez-architecture-center). The other half, and all the 3D and interactive elements, are on the first and second floors of the [Otto G. Richter Library](http://library.miami.edu/). A series of seminars and other events are being held throughout the Fall semester all over campus.

[IVMOOC](http://ivmooc.cns.iu.edu)
----------------------------------

[![ivmooc.png](http://cns.iu.edu/images/openhouses/2014/ivmooc.png)](http://ivmooc.cns.iu.edu)

The 2014 [Information Visualization MOOC](http://ivmooc.cns.iu.edu) final exam closed on March 17, 2014. Of the 82 students who took the exam, 63 scored 80% or above (76.8%), and the median score was 94.1%. This marks a substantial improvement, both in participation and performance, over the previous year.  
  
Instructor Scott Weingart wasn't surprised by the results. "Our students this year are very dedicated, especially those who are going for course credit," he said.  
  
After the final exam, participants moved into the client project portion of the course, joining together to form groups of 4-5 participants with varied skill sets and choosing from [this list of potential projects](http://ivmooc.cns.iu.edu/clients.html?utm_source=April+2014&utm_campaign=April+10%2C+2014&utm_medium=email "IVMOOC Projects").  
  
"It's exciting how many humanistic and social scientific data sets there are, which really caters to students of all interests," Weingart said.  
  
Over the final weeks, the teams were guided through the processes of data collection, cleaning, analysis, and presentation, and went through a week of peer review and feedback before submitting their final projects for grading.
