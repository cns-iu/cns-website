### **Workshop Goals & Agenda:**

This 1½ day workshop will explore approaches to reliably identifying people and their scholarly work including publications, preprints, presentations, grants, and courses taught.  The role of common numbering, federated identity, the semantic web, heuristics, hybrid approaches, and others will be discussed.  Support for team science and emerging applications will require sound identification of people, works, and reliable association of people to their scholarly work.  The consequences of successful identification and association will be credibility and trust in infrastructures supporting scientific work and collaboration.

  

The goals of the meeting are:

*   Present and discuss current approaches to disambiguation in scholarly work.
*   Identify potential synergistic approaches to assured attribution.
*   Outline a course of collaborative activities over the next 5 years.

Given the diverse backgrounds of the participants and the goals of the workshop, we will use the first Â½ day for brief self-introductions, followed by three 30 min overview talks that set the stage for the workshop. The day concludes with a reception at the University of Florida Marston Science Library and a hosted dinner. The second full day features brainstorming and discussion sessions in different team sizes and combinations.
