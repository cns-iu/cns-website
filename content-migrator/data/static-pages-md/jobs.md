Administrative Assistant
------------------------

The Cyberinfrastructure for Network Science Center at Indiana University, Bloomington, is hiring a full time administrative assistant to support our active research center. The administrative assistant will support an interdisciplinary team that includes software developers, data scientists, medical illustrators, biologists, and project managers. Primary areas of responsibility include scheduling, purchasing, arranging travel, event planning, and communications.

The ideal candidate will have both communications skills and the ability to accurately track financial transactions.

The [CNS](https://cns.iu.edu/) mission is to advance research, development, teaching, and service in data mining, modeling, and visualization. Specific foci are increased data visualization literacy and research on multi-level atlases of the structure and evolution of science and technology (see [Mapping Science Exhibit](https://scimaps.org/home)), mapping the human body at the single cell level (see Human Reference Atlas [publication](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-021-00788-6) and [HuBMAP](https://portal.hubmapconsortium.org/) portal), and the communication of results via static and interactive data visualizations (see courses like the [Visible Human MOOC](https://expand.iu.edu/browse/sice/cns/courses/hubmap-visible-human-mooc)).

**Responsibilities:**

*   Provide general administrative support to the Center, exercising tact and confidentiality
*   Serve as a point of contact for visitors and external collaborators

The biomedical consultant will work on the NIH-funded HuBMAP project, which aims to map the human body at single-cell level. They will join an interdisciplinary team that includes software developers, data scientists, medical illustrators, biologists, and project managers at CNS ([https://cns.iu.edu](https://cns.iu.edu)). They will collaborate with external organ experts to catalogue and link anatomical structures, cell types, and biomarkers to the Human Reference Atlas (HRA), document work in standard operating procedures, and contribute to scientific publications. They will work with users of the HRA on defining and implementing existing and new use cases.

The ideal candidate will have strong oral and written communication skills and a unique combination of training and/or prior experience in more than one of the following areas: biomedical imaging, histology, human anatomy and physiology, data analysis, and single cell analyses. Familiarity with multiplexed microscopy image analysis software and molecular biology assays and bioinformatics is a plus. The biomedical expert will have an opportunity to co-author scholarly publications in high-profile scientific outlets.
