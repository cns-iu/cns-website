### Workshop Goals & Agenda:

The workshop will explore the framework and logistical/technical issues associated with developing a nongovernmental platform, currently called PEGASCIS, the Platform for Enhancing Global Academic Strategic Collaboration in Science, to help universities find strategic international partners in science, technology and innovation (STI). The State Department is participating to catalyze platform development that adds strong international components to many ongoing data efforts. This would include expanding institutional profiles beyond research to include data on international engagement, cultural and language collaborations, joint teaching, research and centers, as well as student, faculty, and alumni international associations. Such a platform would make information on U.S. academic institutions easily available to foreign institutions seeking to partner. The platform should be developed to be compatible with and adoptable by many nations, including developing countries, thus enabling U.S. institutions to find appropriate foreign partners. In addition to adding matchmaking power, the platform will enhance understanding global trends in international STI and provide contextual material on best practices in international partnerships, country profiles, and STI foresight.  
  
Workshop objectives include:  

*   Establishing functionality needs for institutional‐level STI partnerships – from users, developers;
*   Exploring status of existing datasets, platforms, visualization and mining tools;
*   Developing ways to leverage existing efforts, especially for international platform components;
*   Determining roles of different stakeholders in advancing platform development; and
*   Developing a consensus on next steps in development of platform.

The workshop outputs will inform a small PEGASCIS Scoping Meeting planned for July 2014 for high‐level  
leaders from universities, foundations, industry, government, and science NGOs to discuss possible  
trajectories for platform development.
