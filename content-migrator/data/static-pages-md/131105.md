### Workshop Goals & Agenda:

This 1.5 day, invitation-only workshop will bring together programmers and power users of major visual analytics/science of science tools. Key goals of the workshop are  

*   improved integration/collaboration between existing tools/developers,
*   the preparation of an international competition that inspires and empowers many to contribute algorithm and tool plugins, and
*   discussion of joint funding applications.

Format is a combination brief presentations, brainstorming sessions, and hands-on sessions--to be finalized when participants are confirmed.

  

Participants, please fill out this [PR^2](/docs/research/workshops/131105/PR2-Macroscopes-Nov13.doc) and send to Samantha Hale ([ude.anaidni@elahjs](mailto:%73%6a%68%61%6c%65%40%69%6e%64%69%61%6e%61%2e%65%64%75?subject=[Workshop] PR^2)) by October 18!
