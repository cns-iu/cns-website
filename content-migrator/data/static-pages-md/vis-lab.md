About
-----

The Visual Insights Studio (VIS) is located in Luddy Hall, room #4012. It is one of six teaching labs in the Department of Intelligent Systems Engineering (ISE) Department at SICE, IUB. It is a space dedicated to teaching and learning but it also engages students in research and development efforts at ISE. Among others, the VIS provides easy access to cutting-edge technologies ranging from an ultra-high resolution (33 million pixels) stereo display wall, audio equipment, HTC VIVE, and Microsoft HoloLens setups for data visualization, scientific visualization, and virtual/augmented/mixed reality R&D.

  

VIS experts collaborate closely with the Advanced Visualization Lab (AVL) and other support and research teams at IU to empower anyone to render data into actionable insights.

  

At a maximum capacity of 33 people, the VIS is a prime space for lectures, talks, demos, and other events that put heavy emphasis on audio-visual presentation.
