### **Workshop Goals & Agenda:**

The communication technologies we are creating today will be driven by a new generation of multidisciplinary thinkers, knowledge workers, global problem solvers, and a more mobile, distributed workforce than ever before. Our new generation has been raised on the Internet, game technologies, mobile landscapes, and new forms of social media as we progress into a knowledge economy that is altering our institutional and organizational practices. The profusion of data and digital information at our fingertips requires new ways to support communication and collaborative sensemaking.

In this emergent landscape, the role of visualization technologies to support synthetic perspectives is becoming increasingly valuable. Deep mapping of emergent science paradigms offer satellite views of humanity’s knowledge. Lightweight visual knowledge systems for public data sharing have evolved to support access to the broader range of information we need to collectively address the world’s most pressing problems.

Media X **_Visualization Vanguard Reception and Tours  
_**In this festive evening, Media X brings together the work of two visualization centers at the cutting edge of mapmaking – Stanford University’s _Spatial History Project_ and Indiana University’s _Places & Spaces: Mapping Science_. Media Xhas convened a unique collaboratory of mapmakers, designers and visualization experts from many disciplines to explore the newest challenges and forecast the future of the field. Please join us at the reception to meet the mapmakers and tour their work.

_Media X_ at Stanford University is proud to sponsor and debut 10 new maps from the fifth iteration of the Places & Spaces -“Science Maps for Science Policy Makers.”Launched in May at Stanford University, the physical exhibit is open to the public Monday through Friday from 8:00 am until 8:00 pm until Decemer 15, 2009.

The _Places & Spaces: Mapping Science Exhibition,_ curated by Dr. Katy Börner, director of the Cyberinfrastructure for Network Science Center at Indiana University and her colleague, Elisha F. Hardy, Places & Spaces was created to inspire cross-disciplinary discussion on how best to track and communicate human activity and scientific progress on a global scale. According to Börner "This exhibit introduces people to the power of maps to navigate physical spaces as well as abstract spaces of our collective scholarly knowledge." This 10-year exhibition program introduces 10 new maps of science each year. [http://www.scimaps.org](http://www.scimaps.org/)
