### Workshop Goals & Agenda:

This 1.5 day, invitation-only workshop will bring together programmers and power users of major visual analytics/science of science tools. Key goals of the workshop are  

*   improved integration/collaboration between existing tools/developers,
*   the preparation of an international competition that inspires and empowers many to contribute algorithm and tool plugins, and
*   discussion of joint funding applications.

Format is a combination brief presentations, brainstorming sessions, and hands-on sessions--to be finalized when participants are confirmed.

  

Participants, please fill out this [PR^2](/docs/research/workshops/051201/PR2-Macroscopes-Nov13.doc) and send to Samantha Hale ([ude.anaidni@elahjs](mailto:%73%6a%68%61%6c%65%40%69%6e%64%69%61%6e%61%2e%65%64%75?subject=[Workshop]%20PR^2)) by October 18!

### Background Information

**Motivation  
**

This meeting will bring together librarians, cartographers and geographers, computer and information scientists, bibliometricians and scientometricians, artists and designers, educators and others with a deep interest in improving access to mankind's scholarly knowledge and expertise. Many invitees are advisory board members of the [Places and Spaces](./) science exhibit. Since April 2005, the exhibit has been displayed at 18 national and international venues attracting a lot of attention and educating people about alternative means - besides Google and other search engines - to access and make sense of what we collectively know. It has also led to the fact that some of us have many more projects and requests for maps of science than they can possibly handle.

**Meeting Goals  
**

This meeting has two goals: (I) It brings together science mapping researchers, designers and educators in an attempt to pool existing tools and resources so that a larger number of well funded requests for easily to understand maps of science can be satisfied. (II) We would like to discuss the next nine iterations of Places and Spaces in an attempt to develop a cohesive outline and plan the next nine years of computational scientometrics research to further bridge the gap between scholarly science mapping efforts and the needs of the general public to benefit and be able to learn from the steadily increasing flood of scholarly data. We plan to realize one iteration per year and envision the followng themes:

*   First iteration compares and contrasts first maps of our entire planet with the first maps of all of science as we know it.
*   The next iteration will compare and contrast existing reference systems (e.g., geographic, astronomic reference systems but also the table of elements used in chemistry, metabolic pathway maps, etc.) with potential reference systems for all of sciences.
*   The third iteration will invite cartographers, designers and artists to render one of two base maps of all of science. The best ten maps will be selected for display.
*   Multi-lingual maps of science versus the use of images, icons, symbols, visualizations, and research results
*   Maps of science in presented and accessed layers from public schools to advanced research laboratories.
*   Interactive maps of science, input and   output methods, and tools for comparing, contrasting, and authenticating data.
*   Daily science 'weather forecasts' in TV and online.
