### **Workshop Goals & Agenda:**

This is a small-scale workshop that brings together History and Philosophy of Science (HPS) researchers that like to dig in data and science map makers that model and map the landscape of science, see http://scimaps.org for sample maps. The goal of the workshop is to explore synergies between these two research areas in terms of

*   Demonstration of existing approaches, tools, and techniques and discussion of synergies.
*   Discussion of different conceptualizations, existing datasets and tools.
*   Identification of opportunities and challenges.

This is a 1 ½ day workshop. Given the diverse backgrounds of the attendees and the goals of the workshop, we will use the first ½ day for brief self introductions of the participants, followed by three 30 min overview talks that set the stage for the workshop. The day concludes with a discussion of challenges and opportunities and a shared dinner. The second full day features brainstorming and discussion sessions in different team sizes and combinations. All sessions take place in Room LI001, Herman B Wells Library, IUB.
