### **Workshop Goals & Agenda:**

This workshop brings together sustainability science researchers, academic organizations, and agencies with initiatives in the field as well as data modeling, and visualization experts to discuss the development and structure in sustainability science research. Results from an NSF funded large-scale analysis of sustainability research will be presented that map the field in terms of its time evolution, geographic distribution, and disciplinary reach. We will also discuss current research trends and agency initiatives, disciplinary integration, education and policy connections.

Given the diverse backgrounds of the participants and the goals of the workshop, we will start the workshop with brief self-introductions, followed by two 30 min talks that set the stage for the workshop. The remaining of the workshop comprises of brief presentations and brainstorming and discussion sessions. Both days of this event (Nov. 30th and Dec. 1st) conclude with a working-dinner that includes discussion groups covering challenges and opportunities for the field and its many components â€“ from policy to education and research.
