### **Workshop Goals & Agenda:**

This 1.5 day, invitation-only workshop will bring together programmers and power users of visual analytics desktop tools and online services. Key goals of the workshop are

*   improved integration/collaboration between existing tools/developers,
*   identification of currently unmet user needs and/or anticipated novel use cases that future tool/service developments should address, and
*   discussion of synergies among efforts and possible joint funding applications.

Format is a combination brief presentations, brainstorming sessions, and hands-on sessions--to be finalized when participants are confirmed.

Participants, please fill out this [PR^2](http://cns.iu.edu/docs/research/workshops/141103/PR2-Macroscopes-2014Nov.docx) and send to [Samantha Hale](mailto:%73%6a%68%61%6c%65%40%69%6e%64%69%61%6e%61%2e%65%64%75?subject=[Workshop]%20PR%5E2) by October 18.

**Overview Talks, Woodburn Hall 200 (Open for public)**

**From Table to Graph: Thomson Reuters Visual Analytics – Julia Laurin, Thomson Reuters**  
Thomson Reuters applications offer a variety of visualizations to enhance understanding and analysis and support informed decision-making. For example, visualization of patent, life sciences, and scholarly research data all contribute to comprehensive understanding of research domains. This talk will review lessons learned, recent developments in Web of Science-based analytics, and current research underway to develop solutions which support graph data and machine learning at big data scales--especially focused on detecting and understanding changes in research output patterns, enabling explorations of relationships and scholarly collaborations, and visualizing temporal analytics.

**[NETEAV](/docs/research/workshops/141103/NETEAV.pdf) - Dmitriy Korobskiy, NETE**  
NETEAV is an on-line platform for visualization that can portray the current state of research and developmental funding, scientific knowledge, and the evolution, current trends and emerging areas of science and pathways to research success. This talk will cover the business needs, conceptual architecture and context, overall project status, and future directions of the NETEAV system.

**[CIShell Tools: The Road Ahead](/docs/research/workshops/141103/CIShell-Tools.pdf) - Daniel Halsey, CNS Center**  
CIShell is CNS’s core macroscope creation framework. It is an open-source, OSGI-compliant, Java codebase that provides a plug-and-play architecture for data reading, analysis and aggregation, and visualization. CNS has created a variety of both targeted and general-use tools based on CIShell (NWB, EPIC, Sci2, etc.), and a number of disconnected tools that integrate output from CIShell-based systems. CNS developers will discuss the history of CIShell, its latest and future interface, plugin, and architectural changes, and the tools and infrastructure that will be used to implement those changes.

**[Scaling Up Learning Communities: ecology of open technologies for analytics and collective intelligence](/docs/research/workshops/141103/Scaling-Up.pdf) - Tam Kien Duong, CRI**  
First, how the CRI is an heterogenous learning community with the students, scientists and extended networks of entrepreneurs and local actors. But if we want to scale, we have to find new networked usages of online/open services that will provide collaborative tools and collective feedbacks. We have found existing software that we are braconizing but we also try to produce our own one (second part). This might be interesting as a conversation starter about ecology of analytic tools and how the tools, platforms and dispositifs fit by complying community standards (with a trending focus on open science, etc) but are also the links between communities.  
Second our projects related to online services and analytics : redwire (a code learning platform oriented toward scientific games), movuino (an open hardware platform to create movements data -- related to quantified self) and ideas like john maeda's Powershop (http://smithery.co/art/maedas-leadership-map/). We have a project similar (rhizi, the project leader was there during our meeting) to the last one but I do not know what its status.

**[Improving Data Visualization Literacy](/docs/research/workshops/141103/Visual-Literacy.pdf) - Katy Börner, CNS Center**  
This talk present the results of a recent study that examined the “data visualization literacy” of over 900 youth and adult visitors across six U.S. science museums. Results show that: a very high proportion of the population, both adult and youth, cannot interpret data visualizations beyond very basic reference systems; construction of complex visualizations led to more accurate interpretation than deconstruction; and individuals are willing to spend time attempting to make meaning in representations depending on their personal interest in the topic. I then discuss a theoretically grounded and practically useful visualization framework that was developed to empower the broadest spectrum of users to read and make data visualizations that are useful and meaningful to them. The visualization framework was used to conduct the aforementioned study and is is used to develop plug-and-play macroscope tools that improve the data visualization literacy of researchers, practitioners, IVMOOC students, museum visitors, and others.
