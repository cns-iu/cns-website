### **Workshop Goals & Agenda:**

This 3-day workshop brings together VIVO & Eagle-i ontology and development teams to discuss the potential alignment of ontologies and systems and seek long-term sustainability.

The goals of the meeting are:

*   Present and discuss current status of VIVO & Eagle-i ontologies and systems.
*   Identify synergistic collaboration opportunities and challenges.
*   Outline a course of activities over the next 5 years.
