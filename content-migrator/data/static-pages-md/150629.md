**Summary:** In a knowledge-based economy, science and technology are omnipresent and their importance is undisputed. Equally evident is the need to allocate resources (both monetary and labor) in an effective way to foster innovation. In the last decades, science policy has embraced scientometrics to gain insights into the structure and evolution of science and devised diverse metrics and indicators. However, it has not invested significant efforts into modelling the dynamics of science, technology, and/or innovation (STI) (mathematically, statistically, and computationally). While it may not be possible to predict the nature and essence of the next scientific or technological innovation, it is often possible to predict the circumstances leading to it, i.e., where it is most likely to happen and under which conditions. Some examples are: Which career paths are more likely to lead to high impact works? Which funding system has the highest return on investments? Which institutions will be most productive over the next years? This workshop invites the community of researchers working on models of STI to both share their latest research and collectively create a roadmap to foster future modeling efforts. Extended abstracts are solicited for presentation and will be reviewed by the workshop organizing committee. We specifically seek models which predict/forecast the structure and/or dynamics of STI. The focus of the workshop is on mathematical, statistical, and computational models, but we do not exclude qualitative models as long as they can be used to develop scenarios of future STI dynamics.

> –User Needs: Who needs what model when? What obstacles exist for using models effectively?  
> –Modelling community: How can we best share expertise, data, code, publications?

17:40 Brainstorming teams report back

18:00 Next Steps
