### Monday, November 30, 4:00-6:00 pm  
[Slides](/images/openhouses/2015/2015-OH.pdf)

Each year, we invite our friends and colleagues to join us for two hours of enlightening talks, hands-on demos, snacks, and drinks. We work hard to make our open house a fun and educational soirée where guests are free to roam about, explore our visualizations, and of course ask questions!  
  
This year's open house will be held at the Social Science Research Commons (SSRC) in Woodburn Hall, near the intersection of E. 7th St. and N. Forrest Ave.  
  
View the talks [here](deadlink.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiana.edu%2F~video%2Fstream%2Flaunchflash.html%3Ffolder%3Dvideo%26filename%3DCNS_Open_House_20151130.mp4).  
  
We'd like to thank all who joined us for this year's Open House, and to all who presented their work. We enjoyed spending time with you all, and sharing the work we've been doing over the past year and the ideas that will guide our future endeavors.

[VISUALIZATIONS](http://cns.iu.edu/visualizations)
--------------------------------------------------

![NETE_screenshot2.jpg](images/openhouses/2014/NETE_screenshot2.jpg)

### NETE A/V Tool

In August 2014, our development team finished an NIH-funded SBIR Phase II project that resulted in a major overhaul of the NETE Analyzer/Visualizer, a web-based data visualization tool originally developed in 2012 and used by NIH program officers.  
  
The all-new responsive interface scales effortlessly from desktop to tablet browsing and boasts several new features aimed at optimizing a variety of visualization types for effective communication of the insights inherent in the data.  
  
It is highly interactive, empowering users to pinch-zoom and pan, search and filter, and click individual nodes to access detailed information. A full-screen option and hide-and-show legend window have been added to give users the cleanest and largest possible view of their data.  
  
The project effectively converts existing Sci2 tool visualizations such as temporal bar graphs, geospatial maps, science maps, and network visualizations into online web services. In the second year, two new visualizations will be added.

[HUMANEXUS RECEIVES ACCOLADES](http://cns.iu.edu/humanexus)
-----------------------------------------------------------

[![Humanexus_DVDInsert.png](images/openhouses/2014/Humanexus_DVDInsert.png)](http://cns.iu.edu/humanexus)_Humanexus: Knowledge and Communication through the Ages_ is the product of a close collaboration between animator Ying-Fang Shen, Katy Börner, and composer and sound designer Norbert Herber, a senior lecturer in Indiana University’s Department of Telecommunications. The film tracks the evolution of human communication from cave scrawls to Twitter feeds, offering a unique depiction of the ever-accelerating spread of information and communication over the course of human history.  
  
The film has garnered worldwide acclaim since its release in 2013, most recently winning the Audience Award at the 2014 Short@ Fringe at Azores Fringe Festival in Azores, Portugal, the Award of Merit at theWorld Film Awards in Jakarta, Indonesia, and Third Prize at the Aviff Cannes Art Film Festival in Cannes, France. See the impressive full list of awards [here](http://cns.iu.edu/humanexus "Humanexus Awards"). Such accolades serve as testimony to both the relevance of the film’s message and the artistic vision through which Shen conveys that message.  
  
You can [watch the trailer for Humanexus here](http://youtube.com/watch?v=qltUjL3Pb4M) and [learn more about the production of the film and its accolades here](http://cns.iu.edu/humanexus).

[PLACES & SPACES EXHIBIT](http://scimaps.org)

[![katy-maps2.jpg](images/openhouses/2015/katy-maps2.jpg)](deadlink.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscimaps.org%2Fmiami)

After ten years of bringing maps of science to the general public, the _Places & Spaces_ exhibition has taken a leap into the world of interactive macroscopes - visualization tools that empower visitors to see data in new ways. The exhibit will soon be rolling out the first four macroscopes, many of which have already garnered praise for their clarity, beauty, and technical innovation. These are only the first of many, as the exhibit’s mission for the next 10 years is to recognize and share best examples of these interactive tools.  
  
The exhibit is just completing an installation at Northwestern University, and will soon be in transition to Atlanta where it opens at the Centers for Disease Control in January.

[IVMOOC](http://ivmooc.cns.iu.edu)
----------------------------------

[![ivmooc.png](images/openhouses/2014/ivmooc.png)](http://ivmooc.cns.iu.edu)

The 2015 [Information Visualization MOOC](http://ivmooc.cns.iu.edu) final exam closed on March 9, 2015. Of the 122 students who took the exam, 77 scored 80% or above (63.1%), and the median score was 85.21%. This marks a substantial improvement in participation over the previous year.  
  
Instructor Michael Ginda attributes the improvements in student participation and engagement with the transition to the Canvas learning management system. "The platform transition gave our team the opportunity to introduce new videos from leading information visualization researchers, improve student discussions forums, and helped instructors reach out to students more effectively," he said.  
  
After the final exam, participants moved into the client project portion of the course, joining together to form groups of 4-5 participants with varied skill sets and choosing from [this list of potential projects](http://ivmooc.cns.iu.edu/clients.html?utm_source=April+2014&utm_campaign=April+10%2C+2014&utm_medium=email).  
  
"This year we've been able to curate our largest and most diverse group of real world client projects to cater to our student's interests and needs," Ginda said.  
  
Over the final weeks, the teams were guided through the processes of data collection, cleaning, analysis, and presentation, and went through a week of peer review and feedback before submitting their final projects for grading.  
  
As part of the final project, students in Indiana University – Bloomington's residential section presented client projects results at the Cyberinfrastructure Building's IQ Wall, which may be [viewed here](https://plus.google.com/photos/110111204963520971562/albums/6145761115979634385).
