============================

As the built environment becomes increasingly more complex and integrated with new technologies—including the emerging Internet of Things—there is an urgent need to understand how embedded technologies affect the experience of individuals that inhabit these spaces.

  

In this camp, students will construct a Dendrite sculpture. The Dendrite is a piece of living architecture that comprises one light sensor (the eye) and actuators such as lights and shape memory alloy that makes the sculpture move together with hardware and software required to control the sensor and actuators.

  

Detailed Dendrite kit assembly instructions are [here](docs/handouts/dendrite-kit.pdf).
