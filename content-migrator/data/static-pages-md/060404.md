### Workshop Goals & Agenda:

**Meeting Goals**  
This meeting aims to (I) pool existing science mapping expertise, tools, and resources, (II) to identify most promising applications for advanced science mapping and knowledge management approaches, and (II) to introduce potential clients to each other and to science mapping experts.  
  
This becomes particulalry relevant given that NSF proposes to fund a new research area called "science metrics" with initially $6.8 million. "The goal is to develop the data, tools and knowledge needed to establish an evidence-based "science of science policy." NSF intends to pursue this research in close cooperation with other agencies." see [Request for National Science Foundation Fiscal Year 2007 Is $6.02 Billion](http://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=105803&org=NSF).  
See also the [2005 AAAS S&T Policy Forum Keynote Address](/docs/research/workshops/060404/marburger.pdf) by John Marburger, Director, Office of Science and Technology Policy, Executive Office of the President in which he argues for a "science of science policy".

Susan Gamble & Michael Wenyon <[wengam@wengam.com](mailto:%20wengam@wengam.com)\>  
  
  
**Tentative Agenda**  
  
Given the diversity of backgrounds of attendees and the goals of this workshop, the agenda was designed to quickly introduce each other, to demo best tools and resources, to gather information on clients needs, to brainstorm in working groups, and to conclude with a discussion of next steps.

### Background Information

**Motivation**  
Katy's talk on [Mapping the Structure and Evolution of Science](http://grants.nih.gov/grants/KM/OERRM/OER_KM_events/Borner.pdf) and the Places & Spaces exhibit installed by Debbie [](deadlink.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvw.indiana.edu%2Fplaces%26spaces%2Fexhibit/06-nih-km2.jpg)at NIH's [Knowledge Management Symposium](http://grants.nih.gov/grants/KM/OERRM/OER_KM_events/) [at the Symposium](deadlink.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvw.indiana.edu%2Fplaces%26spaces%2Fexhibit/06-nih-km2.jpg) inspired diverse requests for science mapping work. We decided to organize a second 'invitation only/no travel support available' workshop that brings together leading science map makers and potential clients interested in science maps and knowledge management tools.  
  

### Travel/Housing:

Please contact Samantha Hale ([ude.anaidni@elahjs](mailto:%73%6a%68%61%6c%65%40%69%6e%64%69%61%6e%61%2e%65%64%75?subject=[Workshop]%20Travel)) for travel arrangement.
