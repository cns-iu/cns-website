### Workshop Goals & Agenda:

This unique gathering will bring together scholars interested in the study of science using scientific methods as suggested by Derek J. deSolla Price more than 40 years ago. Specifically, the workshop will address three questions:  
  
#1) What are the empirical patterns by which science progresses? Examples include the evolution of scholarly networks, the fusion and fission of topic areas, and the study of non-linear feedback cycles.  
#2) What models best simulate the patterns identified in #1?  
#3) How can we best communicate the insights from #1 and #2 to the diverse stakeholders (e.g., researchers, governmental offices, teachers, businesses, and the general public) that are in need of better science management/forecasting tools?  
  
The workshop will have four sessions. The first morning session features brief, 10-minute presentations of researchers' relevant work. The second morning session will be devoted to discussing existing work on question #1 above. After a joint lunch, the workshop will reconvene to address questions #2 & #3. It will conclude with a joint dinner. The workshop will be limited to 20 participants to facilitate intensive discussion and brainstorming.  
  
When assembling our list of dream participants for this workshop, we tried to ensure that we would bring together researchers that have dealt with major scholarly datasets (e.g., ISI data, arxiv, citeseer, patents), experts in development of scalable modeling approaches (e.g., in sociology, economics, and scientometrics, physics), and designers of science maps (see also [http://vw.indiana.edu/places&spaces](./)). A large part of our motivation is to create links between empirical and theoretical approaches to understanding the structure and evolution of science.  
  
In preparation of the workshop, please fill out the [Brief Bio and PR^2: Problems & Pitches](/docs/research/workshops/060521/ModelingSciences-pr2.doc) and submit to [katy@iu.edu](mailto:%20katy@iu.edu) by Thursday May 18th, 2006.  
Note that the workshop is organized independent from, but in conjunction with, the Network Science Workshop and Conference [http://vw.indiana.edu/netsci06](./netsci06/).
