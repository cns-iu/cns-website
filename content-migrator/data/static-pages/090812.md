  <h3><b>Workshop Goals &amp; Agenda:</b></h3>

	<p>The communication technologies we are creating today will be driven by a new
generation of multidisciplinary thinkers, knowledge workers, global problem
solvers, and a more mobile, distributed workforce than ever before. Our new
generation has been raised on the Internet, game technologies, mobile
landscapes, and new forms of social media as we progress into a knowledge
economy that is altering our institutional and organizational practices. The
profusion of data and digital information at our fingertips requires new ways
to support communication and collaborative sensemaking.</p>

<p>In this emergent landscape, the role of visualization technologies to
support synthetic perspectives is becoming increasingly valuable. Deep mapping
of emergent science paradigms offer satellite views of humanity&rsquo;s
knowledge. Lightweight visual knowledge systems for public data sharing have
evolved to support access to the broader range of information we need to
collectively address the world&rsquo;s most pressing problems.</p>

        scientific progress on a global scale. According to Börner "This
        exhibit introduces people to the power of maps to navigate physical
        spaces as well as abstract spaces of our collective scholarly
        knowledge." This 10-year exhibition program introduces 10 new maps of

The project brings together scholars working on projects at the intersection of geography and history using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in their research.
