					</h3>
					<p>
						The visual representation of information requires a deep
						understanding of human perceptual and cognitive capabilities,
						computer graphics, interface and interaction design, as well as
						creativity. <br />
						<br /> Information - such as log files reporting access of
						webpages or paper-citation network data - is typically non-spatial
						or abstract and needs to be mapped into a physical space that will
						represent relationships contained in the information faithfully
						and efficiently. If done successfully, visualizations can provide
						a very intuitive and efficient "interface between two powerful
						information processing systems - the human mind andthe modern
						computer" (Gershom et al., 1998) <br />
						<br /> This course provides an overview about the state of the
						art in the emerging field of information visualization. It will
						highlight the process of producing effective visualizations that
						take the needs of users into account and illustrate practical
						visualization procedures.

					</h3>
					<p>Readings and study in any area of library or information
						science having an extensive literature. A student may enroll for
						this course twice in the same semester under different
						instructors. Normally S601 is completed under the direction of a
						full-time faculty member. Readings done under S601 shall not
						duplicate the content of any course now in the curriculum of the

					</h3>
					<p>
						This course introduces students to major methods, theories, and
						applications of structural data mining and modeling. It covers
						elementary graph theory and matrix algebra, data collection,
						structural data mining, data modeling, and applications. <br />
						<br /> Students will learn how to frame the research question,
						collect the data, run the analysis, and interpret the results. In
						addition, they will learn how to design and evaluate descriptive
						and predictive models of diverse complex networks to improve their
						understanding of the underlying principles. <br />
						<br /> Upon taking this course students will be able to analyze
						and describe real networks (power grids, WWW, social networks,
						etc.) as well as relevant phenomena such as disease propagation,
						search, organizational performance, social power, and the
						diffusion of innovations.

							Systems</a>
					</h3>
					<p>
						The explosion of digitally available information is driving the
						need for more effective, efficient, and natural user interfaces to
						intelligently support access to information, applications, and
						people. This course provides an overview about the state of the
						art in text based, 2-dimensional, and 3-dimensional
						(collaborative) interface design. It will cover task and user
						analysis, interface goals & interface design methods, empirical
						evaluation, and conclude with a discussion of remaining
						fundamental issues in the field. <br />
						<br /> Students will be expected to do readings, provide a
						presentation on specific readings, and participate in discussion.
						They will extensively use web design tools (e.g., Fireworks),
						Javascript, and a 3D Virtual Reality Chat & Design Tool to build a
						number of highly interactive user interfaces in diverse projects.
						Students will conduct task and requirement analysis, learn basic
						interface design principles using JavaScript and 3-D technology
						through application, and design, develop, implement, and evaluate
						collaborative 2-D and 3-D environments.

							Interaction</a>
					</h3>
					<p>
						Human-Computer Interaction, or HCI, tries to extend our
						understanding of what it means to interact with computers and how
						to use this knowledge to improve the design and evaluation of
						products. This course will examine human performance, aspects of
						technology, methods, techniques, and evaluation of interface
						design, as well as societal impact. <br />
						<br /> Students will be expected to do weekly readings, provide a
						presentation on specific readings, and participate in discussion.
						Extensive use will be made of web design tools to build a number
						of user interfaces. Students will conduct formal software
						evaluations and usability tests and present the results to the
						class. The course will be of particular interest for students
						interested in the development and testing of effective and
						efficient computer interfaces.
