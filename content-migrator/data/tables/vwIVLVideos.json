Analysis, navigation, and management of these continuously evolving data sets require a new kind of data-analysis and visualization tool we call a macroscope (from the Greek macros, or “great,” and skopein, or “to observe”) inspired by deRosnay’s futurist science writings. Just as the microscope made it possible for the naked human eye to see cells, microbes, and viruses, thereby advancing biology and medicine, and just as the telescope opened the human mind to the immensity of the cosmos and the conquest of space—the macroscope promises to help make sense of yet another dimension—the infinitely complex.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nGet more info at the <a href=\"http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1897852.1897871\" target=\"_blank\">ACM Digital Library</a>.<br/>\r\nRead the accompanying article <a href=\"http://cns.iu.edu/docs/publications/2011-borner-macroscopes-acm.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.","video_type":"EDUCATIONAL_TALK","link":"http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1897852.1897871","pub_date":"2011-03-11","embedded_video_code":"<iframe src=\"//player.vimeo.com/video/33413091\" width=\"400\" height=\"333\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen  aria-label=\"ACM\"></iframe>"},

She contends in an age of information overload, the ability to make sense of vast amounts of data and to render insightful visualizations is as important as the ability to read and write. The power of visualizations not only to help locate us in physical space but also to help us understand the extent and structure of our collective knowledge, to identify bursts of activity, pathways of ideas, and borders that beg to be crossed. The talk introduces a theoretical visualization framework meant to empower anyone to systematically render data into insights together with tools that support temporal, geospatial, topical, and network analyses and visualizations.
