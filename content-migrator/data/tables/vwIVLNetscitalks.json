Technologies for collecting and storing data have resulted in a data glut that has given rise to the rather general, catch-all topic of \"Big Data\". \r\n\r\nIn many circles, Big Data has taken on a very specific meaning of searching through large amounts of end-user data for a web site, to project their behavior and tune the site to some optimal performance.  In this sense, Big Data is roughly the same as SEO.  It is natural that this sort of application of big data would come first; the data is collected by and belongs to a single organization, and the value from correct analysis of that data goes back to that same organization. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, I want to introduce a trend in Big Data that has much more potential for having a lasting impact on the world.  It is something that I call /Industrial Big Data/.  Like Big Data within an enterprise, Industrial Big Data involves large amounts of interconnected data, over which we wish to perform a wide variety of complex queries.  But in addition to these features of Big Data, Industrial Big Data involves data from multiple sources, with multiple ownership, where the benefits of successful analysis apply not only to a single enterprise, but to whole industries.  \r\n\r\nIndustrial Big Data goes beyond the technological considerations of the size and complexity of the data, to include business motivations for sharing data, data provenance and data governance.  Several industries (including Pharmaceuticals, Oil and Gas, and Finance) are facing Industrial Big Data challenges today.  Because of the differences in business dynamics between these industries, the particulars of their Big Data challenges differ, as do the approaches they are taking to address these challenges.  \r\n\r\nFor all of these industries, the stakes are high.  In this talk, I will evaluate how well these approaches are working, and examine the dire consequences these industries may face if they fail.

During a typical shopping trip, they visit only a fraction of a store’s departments and categories, examine a small subset of the available products, and, in some cases, make selections in just a few seconds.  New research techniques have been developed to help marketers understand how customers allocate their attention in a complex, competitive environment, and assess the impact of in-store factors on shopper behavior.  This paper summarizes studies using video-based customer tracking tools, virtual reality simulations, and eye tracking to identify the drivers of shopper attention, product engagement, and purchase conversion.  These include shopper goals; product assortment, package appearance, price, and merchandising; shelf space allocation, organization, and adjacencies; and salesperson interaction and crowding conditions.  The research reveals that small changes in a product’s appearance and presentation can have a powerful impact on shopper engagement and purchase conversion, and explores the implications for new product testing.","bio":"Raymond R.

In meeting the challenge we set two goals that have been achieved for small data and that it is critical to preserve. The first is deep analysis: comprehensive analysis, including visualization of the detailed data at their finest granularity, which minimizes the risk of losing important information in the data. The second is a computational environment where an analyst programs exclusively with an interactive language for data analysis such as R, making programming with the data very efficient. D&R (<a href=\"http://www.datadr.org/\" target=\"_blank\">datadr.org</a>) is an approach that seeks to achieve these goals.  The data analyst divides the data into subsets and writes them to disk. Then analytic methods are applied to each subset. The analytics are statistical methods whose output is categorical or numeric, and visualization methods whose output is visual. An analytic method is applied to each subset independently of the other subset. Then the outputs of each method are recombined.  In our analyses of large complex data the number of subsets have varied from hundreds to millions. D&R computation is almost all embarrassingly parallel: no communication among parallel computations, which is the simplest parallel computation. This is exploited by RHIPE (R and Hadoop Integrated Processing Environment), which means \"in a moment in Greek\". It is a merger of R and Hadoop that allows a D&R analysis of a large complex dataset to be carried out wholly from within R. For statistical methods applied to the data, D&R estimators have different theoretical properties from the direct whole-data estimators, and are typically less efficient.  However, if the division is carried out using statistical thinking (e.g., stratified sampling) to make each subset as representative as possible, then results can be excellent. This is replicate division. In addition, division is also often guided by variables important to the analysis in which it is natural as an analysis strategy to break up the data according to their values. This is conditioning variable division. For visualization methods, the analyst applies a method to each of a number of subsets, typically not to all because there are far too many to view. Instead, statistical sampling is used to select a limited number. The subsets contain the detailed data, so this enables visualization of the data at its finest granularity. While the sampling is a data reduction method, it is a rigorous one that uses the same statistical thinking as survey sampling, but in D&R there is an advantage because all of the data are in hand, which can be exploited in developing a sampling plan.","bio":"William S.

This may not seem a revolutionary idea on its face, but for the mental health services research field, it has proven a potent scientific/intellectual movement that has influenced treatment and outcomes research and even policy development over the past 20 years. However, the idea of recovery, which had its origins in \"consumer\" criticism of the prevailing psychiatric understanding of illnesses such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, has no clear and agreed-upon definition within the research field. In the absence of agreement and clarity, the various disciplines and approaches to serious mental illness (such as biomedical psychiatry, psychosocial rehabilitation, and peer services) each have adopted significantly different approaches to what it means to be \"recovery-oriented.\" Using main path and positional analysis, this study investigates the most influential works in the field of recovery research and traces the development since 1993, documenting the ways in which the field of psychiatry has managed to reframe the issue of recovery from its implicit critique of the profession into a new field of \"remission\" studies.","bio":"Before arriving at Indiana University, I spent several years as a community journalist in the foothills of the Appalachians.

Since arriving at IUB's sociology department and working with my mentor and dissertation chair, Bernice Pescosolido, my interests have continued to focus on serious mental illness, but have also expanded into social networks and the sociology of organizations. My dissertation is about the scientific/intellectual movement of \"recovery\" in mental health services research over the last 20 year in the United States. I take an explicitly networks-driven approach to studying the community of researchers that has emerged around this topic.

The obvious way from a bibliometric point of view is of course to look at the pattern of journal citations. Though limited, this indicator at least provides a first empirical measure of the links between disciplines and specialties. Most papers on this topic however have analyzed only the recent period, usually after 1980. Thanks to the existence of the \"Century of Science\" database of Thomson-Reuters, we can now look at the long-term evolution of interdisciplinarity over a century and see if we can observe patterns. For the domains of the natural sciences and engineering (NSE) the data suggest a movement of opening up of the major disciplines to contributions from other disciplines over the period 1900-1945, followed by reinforcement of disciplinarity between 1945 and 1975, followed again, in the recent period (1975-2008) by a movement towards more interdisicplinarity. In biomedical sciences, the period 1945-1975, saw a followed since then by a continuous rise of interdisciplinarity, that is, a tendency for most disciplines to open up to other disciplines.

In the sharing process, knowledge flows from one person to another through a variety of channels that includes interpersonal communications, archived information such as books, and modern cyberinfrastructure. Each of these channels enhances or restricts flow in a variety of ways. Constructal theory suggests that the channels naturally evolve to handle more capacity and minimize resistance to flow. The more complex the problem, the more knowledge must be brought to bear, so flow becomes crucial. Project team creativity depends on flow capacity in each type of channel.

Moreover, cells can change their phenotype (key behavioral parameters and state) in response to the tissue microenvironment, even while they remodel this environment. Each cell’s behavior is driven by the complex interplay between its tissue conditions and multi-layer networks at the genomic, proteomic, metabolomics, and other scales. Cancer treatments are applied within this complex, multiscale system. While successful treatments can control or eliminate the tumors, poor outcomes including resistance, increased invasion, side toxicity, and therapeutic failure emerge from this complex system. 3-D simulation systems such as PhysiCell (physics-based multicellular simulator) can assist scientists in understanding complex multicellular cancer systems by simulating many interacting cell agents and the chemical microenvironment. However, they generate high-dimensional data that can be difficult to visualize and understand.

Social network concepts and methodologies – such as two-mode or affiliation networks – can be used to understand drug and alcohol behavior on multiple scales, from molecular processes inside the body to structural anomalies in patterns of ties between millions of actors. An example of the utility and versatility of SNA is provided using the case of doctor shopping (i.e. visiting multiple prescribers) for illicit prescription drugs. This emerging approach seeks to identify and analyze patterns of doctor shopping for opioids and benzodiazepines using two-mode social network analysis of very large, national health insurance claims databases. Results from these analyses can provide important insights to inform effective policies and interventions at the point of service (i.e. prescribers) to reduce prescription drug abuse, diversion, and overdose mortality. Applying two-mode SNA – a complex, systems science methodology – to drug abuse research has the potential to facilitate rapid information extraction from extant datasets for translation to policy and practice, including evaluation of evolving state and federal prescription drug policies and prescription drug monitoring programs. This case demonstrates how SNA might be leveraged to improve population health by increasing our ability to identify complex and often hidden substance abuse pathways and opportunity structures.","bio":"Brea Perry is an Associate Professor of Sociology at Indiana University, and received a Ph.D. in Sociology from IU in 2008.

Because we ultimately want to increase our knowledge of the biochemical and functional roles of genes and proteins in organisms, there is a clear need to integrate the associations and interactions among biological entities that have been reported and accumulate in the literature and databases. Biomedical literature mining is an important informatics methodology for large scale information extraction from repositories of textual documents, as well as for integrating information available in various domain-specific databases and ontologies, ultimately leading to knowledge discovery. It helps us tap into the biomedical collective knowledge, and uncover relationships and interactions buried in the literature and databases, and even those inferred from global information but unreported in individual experiments. Our approach to literature mining is based on bottom-up, data-driven or bio-inspired methods, which we have applied to automatic discovery, classification and annotation of protein-protein and gene-disease interactions, pharmacokinetic data, protein sequence family and structure prediction, functional annotation of transcription data, enzyme annotation publications, and so on.

To examine the possible role of sync and collective performance in collective human systems, we studied stock trading behavior, which shares basic conditions with animal systems of collaboration and competition that face uncertainty. Analyzing novel, stock trader data on $>1$ million moment-to-moment trades and $>2$ million instant messages, we report on the potential dynamics of human synchronicity and its association with collective performance. First, we find non-trivial synchronous human trading of different stocks across various time scales and alternative null models. Second, sync is positively related to performance but in a non-linear manner -- revealing an elusive property of sync found in some animal systems. Third, sync appears to arise without leadership or conscious coordination. Rather, sync emerges through traders' links to their separate instant messaging networks, which are used to disambiguate market information, and which appear to trigger sync when disambiguated market information is at its more advantageous point between risk and reward. This suggests that sync may have untapped benefits for complex human systems and that vanguard communication technology may furnish new opportunities for achieving collective performance in complex human systems.","bio":"Brian Uzzi is the Richard L.

I first present findings that demonstrate that students demonstrated a statistically significant improvement of their understanding of the beehive complex system, using an interview coded for students’ understanding at the structure, behavior, and function level (Danish, 2009). I will then discuss the relationship between different forms of activity in which the students engaged and the different aspects of the content that they discussed. For example, individual drawings appear related to students’ understanding of the honeybee structures, while participatory models helped them link structures to behaviors, and inquiry with the BeeSign software supported students in discussing the honeybee hive from an aggregate level (Danish, 2009; under review).\r\n<br>\r\nAs students engaged in creating representation of honeybees collecting nectar, their representational practices also changed, leading them to be more constructively critical of their peers’ work. I will summarize findings that detail the changes in students’ representational practices (Danish & Phelps, in press) and also the relationship between different representational contexts and students’ engagement with various aspects of representing (Danish, 2010). For example, students creating individual representations were more likely to focus on the “what” of their drawings while students creating skits would shift to discussions of “how” to represent aspects of their drawings and “why”.\r\n<br>\r\nI conclude with a brief discussion of a follow-up study that included 40 first- and second-grade students at a public school in Bloomington Indiana. In this study (Danish, Peppler, Phelps, & Washington, under review) I will highlight student improvement on a test sub-scale related to the aggregate behavior of the honeybee hive, and the role of the BeeSign software in supporting students’ inquiry into this content.","bio":"Joshua Danish is an Assistant Professor in the Learning Sciences program at Indiana University. The overarching theme in his program of research is an examination of how people learn through activity. Learning through activity involves interacting with other people, physical objects, and ideas. Physical objects can range from actual flowers and drawings that label their parts to computer simulations. Similarly, ideas include individual beliefs and preferences, the rules that groups such as classrooms follow, and historically developed concepts that span generations. His research examines how individuals coordinate their actions and ideas within these complex settings, and how this can lead to learning. A major focus of Joshua's work has been examining how young students (5-7 years old) create representations while learning about complex science concepts.","time":"18:00:00","location":"Wells Library 001"},

In this talk, we will report results from extensive artificial life simulations that point to the limited benefits communication has for simple agents in biologically inspired foraging tasks and show that communication can even have detrimental effects on performance in certain environments. Using a combination of statistical analyses of simulation results and complexity-theoretic considerations regarding the (computational) cost of components in agent control architectures, we will argue for the limited utility of communication for any kind of simple organism in an evolutionary setting. The upshot of the argument is that simple agents with simple architectures need very special environmental conditions for communication to benefit them and thus to evolve.

Using data on the calling patterns of 9 million subscribers of a cellular telephone network over a two month period in 2008, we find that weighted reciprocity has a long-tailed distribution, with most dyads characterized by reciprocity, but a significant minority of dyads being non-reciprocal.  We show that variability in the level of reciprocity is related to vertex similarity.  Dyads with vertices that are dissimilar in degree (as well as age and physical location) tend to be reciprocal, while dyads with degree similar vertices vary in their reciprocity levels.  Among degree-similar dyads, non-reciprocity is greater when the vertices are more dissimilar in their vertex strength, i.e. the extent  to which each party makes calls to other people.  These findings call into question sociological theories that view reciprocity as an outgrowth of strong ties among similar people.  Instead we propose a dynamic model in which tie decay among degree-similar dyads is less sensitive to  non-reciprocity.  While in general non-reciprocal dyads are less likely to persist than reciprocal ones, some non-reciprocal dyads persist and these dyads tend to be ones in which the vertices are similar. We conclude by speculating about the possible causes of this greater tolerance for non-reciprocity among degree similar dyads.","bio":"David Hachen is Associate Professor of Sociology and Co-Director Inter-Disciplinary Center for Network Science and Applications (iCeNSA) at the University of Notre Dame.

How to automatically and effectively discover new knowledge from rich multimedia data poses a compelling challenge since most state-of-the-art data mining techniques can only search and extract pre-defined patterns or knowledge from complex heterogeneous data. In light of this challenge, we propose a hybrid approach that allows scientists to use data mining as a first pass, and then forms a closed loop of visual analysis of current results followed by more data mining work inspired by visualization, the results of which can be in turn visualized and lead to the next round of visual exploration and analysis. In this way, new insights and hypotheses gleaned from the raw data and the current level of analysis can contribute to further analysis. As a first step toward this goal, we implement a visualization system with three critical components: (1) A smooth interface between visualization and data mining; (2) A flexible tool to explore and query temporal data derived from raw multimedia data; and (3) A seamless interface between raw multimedia data and derived data. We have developed various ways to visualize both temporal correlations and statistics of multiple derived variables and as well as conditional and high-order statistics. Our visualization tool allows users to explore, compare, and analyze multi-stream derived variables and simultaneously switch to access raw multimedia data.","bio":"Chen Yu received a Ph.D. in computer science from University of Rochester in 2004 before he joined IUB.

To our knowledge, this paper is one of the first to investigate households' private transfers and their willingness to support international aid.  We develop a model of private transfers where households choose their private contributions towards international aid and support for official development assistance based on their preferences, endowments and official development assistance from government sources.   To illuminate the motives for international redistribution, we examine private contributions to international aid organizations using newly available data from the philanthropy supplement to the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). It is estimated that Americans gave $307.65 billion to charitable organizations in 2008 (Giving USA, 2009)  To put the size of charitable donations in perspective, U.S. households gave to charity last year an amount roughly equal to the national incomes of Norway or Indonesia.   However, private giving to international causes account for only 4.3 percent of overall charitable giving. According to the PSID, only four percent of all households surveyed have given to an international aid organization.<br>\r\nWe investigate factors that can explain private giving to international aid and support for public international aid, we examine the role of individual and community level determinants.  One candidate explanation that we explore is the role of one's social environment in influencing attitudes towards households in developing countries.  The role of social environment in influencing economic decisions and outcomes has gained increased attention in the social science literature. Our approach is informed by a number of studies that document that exposure to the poor greatly impacts support for domestic redistribution.  We examine the hypothesis that recent inflows of immigrants may influence attitudes and preferences towards international redistribution.","bio":"Una O.

Open source systems have greatly facilitated design and implementation and supporting cyberinfrastructure. However, there exists no open source integrated system for building an integrated search engine and digital library that focuses on all phases of information and knowledge extraction, such as citation extraction, automated indexing and ranking, chemical formulae search, table indexing, etc. We propose the open source SeerSuite architecture which is a modular, extensible system built on successful OS projects such as Lucene/Solr and discuss its uses in building enterprise search and cyberinfrastructure for the sciences and academia. We highlight application domains with examples from computer science, CiteSeerX, chemistry, ChemXSeer, and archaeology, ArchSeer. CiteSeerX, the successor to CiteSeer, currently offers or intends to offer some unique aspects of search not yet present in other scientific search services or engines, such as table, figure, algorithm and author search. In addition, CiteSeerX continuously crawls the web and author submissions and now has nearly 1.5 million documents, close to 30 million citations, a million authors and comparable database tables. It has nearly 1 million unique users with several million hits a day. In chemistry, the growth of data has been explosive and timely, and effective information and data access is critical. The ChemXSeer (funded by NSF Chemistry) system is a portal and search engine for academic researchers in environmental chemistry, which integrates the scientific literature with experimental, analytical and simulation datasets. ChemXSeer consists of information crawled from the web, manual submission of scientific documents and user submitted datasets, as well as scientific documents and metadata provided by major publishers. Information gathered from the web is publicly accessible whereas access to restricted resources such as user submitted data will be determined by those users. Thus, instead of being a fully open search engine and repository, ChemXSeer will be a hybrid one, limiting access to some resources. Because such enterprise systems require unique information extraction approaches, several different machine learning methods, such as conditional random fields, support vector machines, mutual information based feature selection, sequence mining, etc. are critical for performance.

Here we introduce a network approach to capture the statistical properties of the structure of conformation spaces, and reveal the correlations induced in the energy landscape by the self-avoidance property of a polypeptide chain. We show that the folding pathways along energy gradients organize themselves into scale free networks, thus explaining previous observations made via Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. We also show that these energy landscape correlations are essential for recovering the observed connectivity exponent, which belongs to a different universality class than that of random energy models.

In services research, the meaning of recovery in severe mental illness (SMI) is contested, but refers broadly to the idea that the long-term prospects of people with SMI need not be dire and illness-defined. Instead, the concept of recovery suggests the care of SMI should be person- and future-oriented and should allow individuals to work toward personally meaningful goals. While this may not seem to outsiders as much of a challenge to service providers, in the 1980s and beyond, recovery became a rallying cry for those who sought to contest overly custodial and pessimistic providers and systems of care. The recovery \"movement\" in the research literature appears to be what Frickel and Gross termed a scientific/intellectual movement (2005). This study expands the network argument of the SIM framework and examines the evolution of the recovery research network through co-authorship and past and present academic, clinical, disciplinary and other professional affiliations.

The underlying analysis is based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Topic Modeling) which scales well to collections of millions to billions of documents. We use large-scale graph visualization techniques to build a map of the documents within a corpus using a scalable force-directed layout algorithm. This map then forms the basis of a Google Maps user interface that has additional web-support to describe individual documents within the collection.

These data are then aggregated across groups of varying size, from households to nation states. In comparison, we have very limited data about the interactions between people. Social interactions are fleeting and mostly private, making them hard to capture and arduous to hand-code and record. These problems are compounded by the need for repeated observations and by the exponential increase in the number of relations as group size increases. As a result, social dynamics are not systematically documented at the relational level, except in observational and ethnographic studies of small groups. All this is rapidly changing as human interactions move increasingly online, leaving digital records that allow automatic data collection on an unprecedented scale. However, social scientists have been reluctant to embrace the study of what is often characterized as the \"virtual world,\" as if human interaction somehow becomes metaphysical the moment it is mediated by information technologies. While great care must be exercised in generalizing to the offline world, the digital traces of computer-mediated interactions open a window on aspects of social life that have been previously hidden from view. The detailed records of interaction in online communities are unique in human history, providing an exceptional opportunity for research on the formation of communities, a broad topic that includes research questions ranging from recruitment of new members to the emergence, spread, and enforcement of norms. Are new members influenced to join primarily through commitment to shared goals or do they tend to be pulled in by friends who have already joined? Are people influenced more by strong ties to close friends who also know one another, as in a tightly clustered network, or are they influenced more by weak ties to acquaintances who do not know one another and thus are more likely to have access to non-redundant information? Are people and organizations attracted to similar others, or does similarity lead to competition and rivalry? Does the dynamic of influence and attraction lead to cultural convergence or differentiation?

Users access these resources from the nanoHUB.org web site. In the 12-month period from October 2006 to September 2007, more than 26,000 users accessed nanoHUB to view a collection of seminars, tutorials, animations, publications, and simulation tools submitted by more than 390 contributors from all over the world. But the nanoHUB is more than just a repository. It is a place where researchers and educators can meet and accomplish real work. The nanoHUB offers integrated, online web meetings via Macromedia Breeze, source code collaboration through its nanoFORGE area, events calendars, and many other services designed to connect researchers and build a community. Most importantly, the nanoHUB connects users to the simulation tools they need for research and education. Users can access more than 50 interactive, graphical tools, and not only launch jobs, but also visualize and analyze the results-all via an ordinary web browser. In the same 12-month period mentioned earlier, more than 5,900 users performed over 226,000 online simulations. The NCN's emphasis on usability has produced a clean interface that makes it easy to use powerful research tools.

A router's ability to manipulate essentially all network traffic coming in to and out of a home, means that malware installed on these devices has the ability to launch powerful Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks, a form of attack that has previously been largely ignored. Making matters worse, many homes have deployed wireless routers which are insecure if the attacker has geographic proximity to the router and can connect to it over its wireless channel. However, some have downplayed this risk by suggesting that attackers will be unwilling to spend the time and resources necessary, nor risk exposure to attack a large number of routers in this fashion. In this talk, we will consider the ability of malware to propagate from wireless router to wireless router over the wireless channel, infecting large urban areas where such routers are deployed relatively densely. We develop an SIR epidemiological model, and use it to simulate the spread of malware over major metropolitan centers in the US. Using hobbyist collected wardriving data from Wigle.net and our model, we show the potential for the infection of tens of thousands of routers in short periods of time is quite feasible. We consider simple prescriptive suggestions to minimize the likelihood that such attacks are ever performed. Next, we show a simple yet worrisome attacks that can easily and silently be performed from infected routers. We call this attack 'Trawler Phishing'. The attack generalizes a well understood failure of many web-sites to properly implement SSL, and allows attackers to harvest credentials from victims over a period of time, without the need to use spamming techniques or mimicked, but illegitimate web-sites, as in traditional phishing attacks, bypassing the most effective phishing prevention technologies. Further, it allows attackers to easily form data-portfolios on many victims, making collected data substantially more valuable.

As science begins to address large-scale systems, the growing complexity of scientific work processes requires new infrastructure for understanding and managing the production of knowledge from distributed observation, simulation, analysis, and discourse activities. Cyberenvironments extend existing science application capabilities to include the ability to record, analyze, and interpret provenance documentation describing the causal relationships between processes and artifacts in scientific work. Using provenance-enabled collaboration and analysis tools, scientists can efficiently assess, validate, reproduce, and refine experiments and results. Provenance documentation enriches the scientific research record, enabling significant results to be preserved along with much of the associated information necessary to correctly interpret them. NCSA's suite of prototype Cyberenvironment tools is based around the idea of semantic content networks and built around the World Wide Web Consortium's Resource Description Framework (RDF). RDF provides an application and domain-neutral way to represent metadata, and can thus be used to link domain-specific information with generic vocabularies for describing artifacts and work processes. NCSA's work in the Grid Provenance Challenge, for instance, has demonstrated the applicability of RDF to representing scientific workflow executions, enabling data products to be linked via RDF to descriptions of the complex processes that produced them. The emerging Open Provenance Model attempts to further abstract the notion of causal relationships in scientific and other work processes, allowing provenance-enabled tools to link independently-observed processes together form descriptions of larger-scale processes. The scientific research record can then be understood as a semantic network of causality and thus be linked with other relevant networks, such as social networks, to provide a comprehensive model of scientific work that can be applied to new communities to build powerful science Cyberenvironments that maximize the impact of collaborative, systems-scale scientific work.

Some early scientists and philosophers reasoned that there must be, based on the paleontological record.  Some object to a potential anthropocentric chauvinism to the interpretation of complexity in these records.  Others, notably McShea and Gould, suggest a distinction between \"driven\" and \"passive\" selection for complexity, where the former corresponds to an active, non-random process biased towards increasing complexity, while the latter corresponds to a random process of diffusion away from a lower bound of complexity. Attempts to distinguish between driven and passive selection in the fossil record have met with mixed results, providing evidence for both conclusions.  I will describe an experiment using a computer model of an evolving ecology in which agent behaviors are driven by artificial neural networks, the architecture of which is the primary subject of either natural selection or a random diffusion process. An information theoretic measure of the complexity of the resulting neural dynamics allows an investigation of the distinction between driven and passive selection.  The results of this study suggest a simple explanation for the variability in biological studies of evolutionary trajectories, which is that under certain conditions evolution does indeed select for complexity, in a driven fashion, faster than one would see with a purely random, diffusive process. But this is only the case when additional complexity confers an evolutionary advantage on the affected agents.  Under other conditions, natural selection for \"good enough\" solutions can reduce complexity growth relative to that observed in a passive, randomly diffusing system, even when all other contributing factors are held constant.  Thus evolutionary complexity is neither entirely driven nor entirely passive, in McShea's sense, but is unavoidably a blend of the two forces, depending in a reasonably intuitive fashion on the evolutionary value of incremental gains in complexity.","bio":"","time":"18:00:00","location":"Wells Library 001"},

The advent of social media is disrupting these mechanisms by fostering Web-mediated brokers such as blogs, wikis, folksonomies, and search engines, through which anyone can easily publish and promote content online. This \"second age of information'' is driven more than ever before by the economy of attention. Popularity (the accumulation of attention) is its measure of success;  popular sources have formidable power to impact opinions, culture, and policy, as well as profit through online advertising. Yet the dynamical processes that drive popularity in our online world are still unclear and largely unexplored. Here we provide for the first time a quantitative, large scale, longitudinal analysis of the dynamics of different popularity measures for online content.  We analyze the evolution of two massive model systems, the Wikipedia and an entire country's Web space, finding that the temporal and magnitude behaviors of popularity follow statistical laws typical of critical avalanche processes, such as earthquakes and depinning phenomena. Such statistical features hold across measures, systems, and their histories. To make sense of these empirical results, we offer a model that mimicks with a simple random mechanism the exogenous shift of user attention and the ensuing non-linear perturbations in the popularity ranking of online resources. Remarkably this stylized model recovers the key features observed in the empirical analysis of the two model systems analyzed here.\r\n<br><br>\r\nJoint work with Jacob Ratkiewicz, Santo Fortunato, Alessandro Flammini, and Alessandro Vespignani.","bio":"","time":"18:00:00","location":"Wells Library 001"},

For a start, we would not even know what 90% of the components do, let alone which appliance they are for. This is where we find ourselves in biology at the moment. Amazing advances have been made in identifying the basic building blocks of life: proteins. The sequencing of genomes of multiple different species has produced an almost exhaustive catalogue of the proteins. This is a great wealth of data. However, only a few of these proteins are understood, and their interactions even less so: there are no instructions in the box. Proteins form the basis of most biological structures, and of the biochemical reactions we understand as life. The key challenge in this new century is to understand how these components (the proteins) work together.

This suggests that dream reports might be a useful source ofinformation about social networks; then again, given the bizarre events that sometimes occur in dreams, dream reports may contain nothing systematic. For three individuals, dream reports were coded for the characters occurring in each dream. An affiliation network was constructed for each dreamer, by considering each character as a vertex, and joining two characters with an edge if they were present in a dream together. Two of the resulting social networks have the small world properties of short average path lengths and high clustering (i.e., transitivity). The network for one dreamer is different, with lower clustering than the others. The number of characters present in at least one dream with a certain character is called the degree of the character. The distribution of degrees in the dream social networks follows Zipf's Law, as often occurs in waking social networks. During dreaming, there is little input from the senses, so it is proposed that properties of a dream social network must arise from corresponding properties of the representation of people in the dreamer'smemory. However, a dream social network is not a carbon copy of the dreamer's waking social network; for example, dream networks include celebrities.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate integration and segregation changes in structural connectivity (SC) that arise as consequence of white matter lesions in hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with spheroids (HDLS).\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nHDLS is a rare autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in the CSF1R gene. HDLS is characterized by severe white matter damage leading to prominent subcortical lesions detectable by structural MRI.  Spheroids, an important feature of HDLS, are axonal swellings indicating damage. HDLS causes progressive motor and cognitive decline. The clinical symptoms of HDLS are often mistaken for other diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, frontotemporal dementia, atypical Parkinsonism or multiple sclerosis. Our study is focused on the follow-up of two siblings, one being a healthy control (HC) and the other one being an HDLS patient.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn this report, deterministic fiber-tractography of diffusion MRI with multi-tensor modeling was used in order to obtain reliable and reproducible SC matrices. Integration changes were measured by means of SC shortest-paths (including distance and number of edges), whereas segregation and community organization were measured by means of a multiplex modularity analysis on the SC matrices. \r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nMajor integration disruption involved superior frontal (L,R), caudal middle frontal (R), precentral (L,R), inferior parietal (R), insula (R) and paracentral (L) regions. Major segregation changes were characterized by the disruption of a large bilateral module that was observed in the HC that includes the frontal pole (L,R), medial orbitofrontal (L,R), rostral middle frontal (L), superior frontal (L,R), precentral (L,R), paracentral (L,R), rostral anterior cingulate (L,R), caudal anterior cingulate (L,R), posterior cingulate (L,R), postcentral (L), precuneus (L,R), lateral orbitofrontal (R) and parsorbitalis (R).\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe combination of tractography and network analysis permitted the detection and characterization of profound cortical to cortical changes in integration and segregation associated with HDLS white matter lesions.

Brown-headed cowbirds are an intriguing species because of their parasitic nature; females lay eggs in other species' nests who raise the young cowbirds to independence. Evolutionists have considered cowbirds as the model species to have a \"genetic safety net\" that would require no learning for reproduction. Previous research by our lab, however, has demonstrated cowbirds need to learn both social and vocal behavior from older conspecifics in order to be reproductively successful. The present study uses social network techniques to understand individual reproductive success. We studied three flocks composed of juvenile females, adult females and adult males in three large semi-naturalistic aviaries. From March to May, we documented social and vocal behavior in each flock. In early May, the three aviaries were opened to form one large aviary allowing birds the opportunity to interact and mate with individuals from all three flocks. Reproductive measures were collected during both time periods and microsatellite genotyping was conducted to analyze parentage of fertile eggs. Social networks analyses were used to link the reproductive success with social measures. ","bio":"","time":"18:00:00","location":"Wells Library 001"},

In contrast, in Nature several processes have been discovered which alter genetic information encoded in DNA before it is translated into amino-acid chains. Ontogenetically altered genetic information is not inherited but extensively used in regulation and development of phenotypes, giving organisms the ability to, in a sense, re-program their genotypes according to environmental clues. An example of post-transcriptional alteration of gene-encoding sequences is the process of RNA Editing. Here we introduce a novel Agent-based model of genotype editing and a computational study of its evolutionary performance in static and dynamic environments. This model builds on our previous Genetic Algorithm with Edition, but presents a fundamentally novel architecture in which coding and non-coding genetic components are allowed to coevolve. Our goal is twofold: (1) to study the role of RNA Editing regulation in the evolutionary process, and (2) to investigate the conditions under which genotype edition improves the optimization performance of evolutionary algorithms. We show that genotype edition allows evolving agents to perform better in several classes of fitness functions, both in static and dynamic environments. We also present evidence that the indirect genotype/phenotype mapping resulting from genotype editing leads to a better exploration/exploitation compromise of the search process. Therefore, we show that our biologically-inspired model of genotype edition can be used to both facilitate understanding of the evolutionary role of RNA regulation based on genotype editing in biology, and advance the current state of research in Evolutionary Computation.","bio":"","time":"18:00:00","location":"Wells Library 001"},

Over 15 rounds of problem solving, participants received feedback not only on the success of their own solutions to a simple search problem, but also on their neighbors¹ solutions and outcomes. Neighbors were determined by one of four network topologies: locally connected lattice, random, fully connected, and small-world (e.g. a lattice plus a few long-range connections). The results suggest that complete information is not always beneficial for a group, and that problem spaces requiring substantial exploration may benefit from networks with mostly locally connected individuals. We model the dissemination of innovations in these experiments using agents that probabilistically select choices guided by their own and their neighbors' explorations.","bio":"","time":"18:00:00","location":"Wells Library 001"},

Querying works well when a user has a clear goal of information seeking and knows how to formulate an effective query, whereas browsing is more useful when a user has a vague (exploratory) information need, or when a user cannot easily formulate an effecive query. Although users can freely query any information space by using a search engine, they only have very limited support for browsing, which currently can only be done based on manually generated links or category hierarchies. In order to freely browse an information space, users would need a more comprehensive topic map that can connect and organize all the information items in a meaningful way. Unfortunately, manual construction of such a topic map is labor-intensive and thus does not scale up well. In this talk, I will present two case studies of automatically constructing a topic map to enable effective browsing. In the first, we propose to view the search log data naturally available for an operational search system as the information footprints left by users and organize search logs into a multiresolution topic map, which enables a user to follw the footprints left by previous users to explore information flexibly. As new users use the map for navigation, they leave more footprints, which can then be used to enrich and refine the map dynamically and continuously for the benefit of future users, leading to a sustainable infrastructure to facilitate users to surf the information space in a collaborative manner. In the second, we develop probabilistic generative models to extract topics in text collections and connect them into various topic maps that can represent the information space from different perspectives. Such maps reveal interesting topic patterns buried in the text data and enable users to flexibly follow topic patterns and navigate into detailed information about each topic. In the end of the talk, I will discuss some challenges to be solved in order to seamlessly integrate querying and browsing to support multi-mode information seeking and analysis.","bio":"ChengXiang Zhai is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he also holds a joint appointment at the Graduate School of Library and Information Science, Institute for Genomic Biology, and Department of Statistics.

Having been developed since 1972, the INPC is an operational, community-wide electronic medical record that supports patient care for 13 million patients in Indiana and neighboring states. For these patients, it hosts detailed healthcare data, including 28m registration “events,” 1.7b clinical observations, 840m encounter events, 580m claims observations (procedures, prescriptions, etc.) and 118m text reports. For many participating institutions, the INPC stores a wide range of clinical information, such as demographics, visit dates, chief complaints, problem lists and diagnoses, laboratory results, physician notes, orders, medications, vital signs, and admissions and discharge summaries/instructions. Today, a volume of 2m transactions, coming from 25,000 clinicians, 106 hospitals, county and state public health departments, national laboratories, pharmacies is added to the INPC daily.\r\n<br><br>\r\n \r\nThe question is how can we most effectively learn from his large body of real-world healthcare data? The Regenstrief Institute and its collaborators have, over several decades, conducted retrospective studies using the INPC in order to elucidate various clinical conditions, and their treatments and outcomes. For example, we have found that steroid inhalers lead to more gastrointestinal problems that can be mitigated by using a spacer; physicians who perform more endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, a technically difficult procedure performed on the pancreas, have better patient outcomes; a substantial proportion of patients with osteoporosis remain at high risk of fractures despite adherence to medicines; taking certain combinations of medicines may increase the risk of myopathy (a muscle disorder).   However, we estimate that we have only exploited a small fraction of the potential lessons that INPC data could teach us.\r\n <br><br>\r\n\r\nIn order to increase our “analytical bandwidth,” we are looking to leverage novel analytical and visualization methodologies.

The updated map and classification adds six years (2005-2010) of WoS data and three years (2006-2008) from Scopus to the existing category structure—increasing the number of source titles to about 25,000. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a widely used map of science was updated. A comparison of the original 5-year and the new 10-year maps and classification system show (i) an increase in the total number of journals that can be mapped by 9,409 journals (social sciences had a 80% increase,  humanities a 119% increase, medical (32%) and natural science (74%)), (ii) a simplification of the map by assigning all but five highly interdisciplinary journals to exactly one discipline, (iii) a more even distribution of journals over the 554 subdisciplines and 13 disciplines when calculating the coefficient of variation, and (iv) a better reflection of journal clusters when compared with paper-level citation data.

Extensions have been introduced where nodes attach proportional to arbitrary fitness functions. However, in these models attaching to a node increases the ability of that node to gain more links in the future. We study network growth where nodes attach proportional to the clustering coefficients, or local densities of triangles, of existing nodes. Attaching to a node typically lowers its clustering coefficient, in contrast to preferential attachment or rich-get-richer models. This simple modification naturally leads to a variety of rich phenomena, including non-poissonian bursty dynamics, community formation, aging and renewal. This shows that complex network structure can be modeled without artificially imposing multiple dynamical mechanisms.","bio":"James Bagrow joined Northwestern's Department of Engineering Sciences and Applied Mathematics in 2011.

Specifically, Project Risk Assessment for Mexican Americans (RAMA) investigated the impact of Family health history (FHH)-based risk feedback on the risk communication and screening encouragement pathways in families of Mexican origin. All 465 participants from 161 households received a FHH pedigree. Households were randomized to one of four feedback conditions defined by two factors: 1) all or one participating household member received supplemental, personalized FHH-based risk assessments and 2) whether or not behavioral recommendations accompanied these personalized risk assessments. Personalized risk assessments and behavioral recommendations for heart disease and diabetes were generated using the CDC's Family Healthware. Outcomes included enumerated family members with whom participants shared feedback and discussed family risk of heart disease and diabetes at 3-month follow-up and from whom they received encouragement to engage in risk reducing behaviors at 10-month follow-up. Participants from households in which all members received supplemental RAs were more likely to initiate new communication pathways regarding family risk of heart disease, but not diabetes, at 3-month follow-up. At 10-month follow-up, participants from households in which everyone received a RA and behavioral recommendations were more likely to enumerate new encouragers of blood pressure and blood glucose testing. With respect to encouragement of lifestyle factors, participants in households in which all members received supplemental RAs were more likely to enumerate new encouragers of increased fruit and vegetable consumption at 10-month follow-up, while provision of behavioral recommendations improved encouragement for maintaining a healthy weight. Results suggest that a family-centered FHH-based feedback approach was more effective than an individual level approach in activating risk communication and behavioral encouragement pathways within family network systems.

In this talk we will explore a series of analyses examining the structure and content of political communication on Twitter surrounding the 2010 U.S. congressional elections. Using a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods we demonstrate that the network of political retweets exhibits a highly segregated partisan structure, with extremely limited connectivity between left- and right-leaning users. Surprisingly this is not the case for the user-to-user mention network, which is dominated by a single politically heterogeneous cluster of users in which ideologically opposed individuals interact at a much higher rate compared to the network of retweets. Building on this foundation, we develop a set of machine learning apparatuses that use network (94.5% accuracy) and text (90.8% accuracy) features to predict the political alignment of nearly 20,000 politically active Twitter users. Using these predictions as high-fidelity proxies for political alignment, we find that in contrast to the 2008 election cycle, right-leaning users allocate substantially more attention to political communication and exhibit a more tightly interconnected network structure, characteristics which facilitate the rapid and broad dissemination of political information. We conclude with an exploration of the policy focuses of these two groups, identifying key differences in the agendas of right- and left-leaning social media users ahead of the midterm elections.","bio":"Michael Conover is a Ph.D. student studying complex systems analysis at the Indiana University School of Informatics and Computing's Center for Complex Networks and Systems Research.

This paper re-visits this core concept to explore its potential for serving as the foundation for a systematic approach to the construction of more elaborate models of complex policy networks in which overlapping sets of actors have the ability to influence the rules under which their strategic interactions take place. Networks of adjacent action situations can be built on the basis of the seven distinct types of rules that define an action situation or by representing generic governance tasks identified in related research on local public economies. The potential of this extension of the IAD framework is demonstrated with simplified network representations of three diverse policy areas (Maine lobster fisheries, international development assistance, and the contribution of faith-based organizations to U.S. welfare policy).

The natural vibration properties of the structure can be estimated using a multivariate autoregressive model (AR model) of its measured response to ambient vibrations. Fitting a multivariate AR model to the observed data requires the computation of the lagged covariance between measurements in all nodes. The resulting volume of data transmission causes significant latency due to the low data bandwidth of WSNs in addition to having a high transmission energy cost. In this talk, a set of physically motivated restrictions to the estimation of the AR model is presented. Such restrictions significantly reduce the volume of data flowing through the WSN, thus reducing the latency in obtaining modal parameters and extending the battery lifetime of the WSN. The stabilization plots for the restricted and full AR models fitted using data simulated from linear structures are compared. Data collected from a WSN deployed on the Golden Gate Bridge are used to compare the stabilization plots and the estimated modes using the restricted and full AR models. The comparisons show that the restricted form of the AR leads to estimates of the modal parameters of comparable quality to that of the full AR model while substantially reducing the volume of transmitted data.","bio":"Guilherme (G as in goal + Willliam) has a degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Sao Paulo in 1999, his M.S. in Economics from the Getulio Vargas Foundation in 2003 and a Ph.D. in Statistics from University of California, Berkeley in 2008.

Furthermore, associating the genetic determinants that underlie natural ionomics variation, with the landscape of the individuals that carry these genotypes, will provide insight into the genetic basis of adaptation and speciation. We have employed high-throughput mineral nutrient and trace element profiling, using inductively coupled plasma – mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), as a tool to determine the biological significance of connections between an organisms genome and its ionome. Our focus is on genes that control uptake and accumulation of mineral elements, including Ca, K, Mg, P (macronutrients in plant fertilizer), Co, Cu, Fe, Li, Mn, Mo, Ni, Se, Zn, (micronutrients of significance to plant and human health) and As, Cd, Na and Pb (elements causing agricultural or environmental problems). To date we have analyzed the ionome of over 100,000 Arabidopsis plants and 20,000 yeast samples. This includes several Arabidopsis forward genetic screens (Lahner et al., 2003 Nat. Biotechnol. 21:1215), a screen of 360 natural Arabidopsis accession, and a complete analysis of all 5153 strains of the yeast deletion collection (Danku et al., 2009 JAAS (in press)). We have successfully used PCR-based positional cloning, DNA microarray based approaches, QTL and association mapping to identify numerous genes that control the ionome (for example Rus et al., 2006 PLoS Genetics 2(12): e210; Baxter et al., 2008 PLoS Genetics 4(2):e1000004). Association of variation in these genes with the landscape in which these plants naturally grow is starting to reveal the genetic architecture underlying specific adaptations to the environment. We are also finding that specific ionomic “fingerprints” are associated with functionally related sets of genes, and also with the physiological status of the organism (Baxter et al., 2008 PNAS 105: 12081-12086). To maximize the value of this ionomics approach, we have developed a publicly searchable online database containing ionomic information on over 1000,000 samples from over 1500 different experiments (www.ionomicshub.org; Baxter et al., 2007 Plant Physiol 143: 600-611), and the database is being updated regularly.","bio":"","time":"18:00:00","location":"Wells Library 001"},

However, we know remarkably little about how such traits might originate in the first place. What are the  genetic, developmental, and ecological mechanisms, and the interactions between them, that mediate not just the modification of existing traits, but the origin of novel traits and trait diversity? In my talk I explore the genetic, developmental, and ecological underpinnings of a class of traits that is both novel and highly diverse: beetle horns. Several thousand species of beetles express horns, and dramatic variation in size, location, shape, and number of horns exist both within and between species. Most importantly, beetle horns lack obvious homology to other insect traits, instead they can be viewed as a novel feature that horned beetles invented during their evolutionary history, and which has since undergone one of the most dramatic trait radiations in the animal kingdom. Using a combination of morphological, developmental, genetic and genomic studies I explore the evolutionary origins of horns, as well as the mechanisms that mediated the subsequent diversification of horn expression across spe","bio":"","time":"18:00:00","location":"Wells Library 001"},

To explain these correlated network states, two groups recently applied a second-order maximum entropy model that used only observed firing rates and pairwise interactions as parameters (Schneidman et al., 2006; Shlens et al., 2006). Interestingly, with these minimal assumptions they predicted 90-99% of network correlations. If generally applicable, this approach could vastly simplify analyses of complex networks. However, this initial work was done largely on retinal tissue, and its applicability to cortical circuits is unknown. This work also did not address the temporal evolution of correlated states. To investigate these issues, we applied the model to multielectrode data containing spontaneous spikes or local field potentials from cortical slices and cultures. The model worked slightly less well in cortex than in retina, accounting for 88% ± 7% (mean ± s.d.) of network correlations. In addition, in 8/13 preparations the observed sequences of correlated states were significantly longer than predicted by concatenating states from the model. This suggested that temporal dependencies are a common feature of cortical network activity, and should be considered in future models. We found a significant relationship between strong pairwise temporal correlations and observed sequence length, suggesting that pairwise temporal correlations may allow the model to be extended into the temporal domain. We conclude that while a second-order maximum entropy model successfully predicts correlated states in cortical networks, it should be extended to account for temporal correlations observed between states.

To briefly summarize, Forest Transition Theory (FTT) suggests that nations experience dramatic deforestation during a frontier period of heavy resource use and this deforestation phase is eventually followed by a period of reforestation after some period of economic development. A considerable amount of research has focused on the drivers of deforestation but we have a less complete understanding of the diverse factors contributing to reforestation and the prospects for a transition from deforestation to reforestation in different economies. These forest cover trajectories are the result of interactions between social and ecological processes operating at multiple spatial and temporal scales and there are numerous methodological approaches that have been used to examine the complexity in these coupled social-ecological systems. This presentation summarizes findings to date from research examining the role of landuse decision-making in land cover change in the Midwest United States, Brazil and Laos. Results are presented from the integration of agent-based models of land cover change and empirical data drawn from social surveys and remotely sensed data (aerial photography and satellite imagery).

McEvily, Perrone, and Zaheer (2003, p. 1), for example, contend that while \"trust has long figured prominently in scholarly and lay discourse alike;\" it is only recently that organizational researchers have started devoting substantial attention to understanding the significance of trust. This is due to two simultaneous developments related an emphasis on collaboration, and changes in technology \"that have reconfigured exchange and the coordination of work across distance and time.\" In this study, we tested three proposed models (additive, moderation, and mediation) to determine the role of trust in its relationship with communication and performance. Using the SNA perspespective, we conceptualize trustworthiness and communication in terms of centrality with respect to these factors. Our results indicate that the mediating model best explains the role of trust centrality but considering all three models presents a more complex picture. The strong support for the mediation model indicates that trust centrality generally acts as a mediator between communication centrality and performance. That is, the path through which communication leads to performance is through trust. The moderation model adds some nuances to the above general finding. It suggests that for trustworthy individuals, communication can enhance their performance. But, for those who are perceived as less trustworthy, high levels of communication can backfire. Their communication is perceived can be a source of annoyance, and unproductive use of the recipient's time. ","bio":"","time":"18:00:00","location":"Wells Library 001"},

Social networks are complex.\r\nTypical corporate networks are millions of times as complex as a simple social network structure.\r\nComplexity is a function of robust attribute data on the nodes (people), multiple relations and links between nodes, valued relations, degradation of relations over time, and the breadth and density of enterprise networks, where typical networks include tens of millions of relations between millions of nodes.\r\n<br>\r\n2. Supporting data structures are complex.\r\nSimple networks can be rendered as sociomatrices. Complex networks required tiered sociomatrices for\r\nintelligent analysis and application of SNA theory. Complexity is compounded by the disparate sources of\r\nrelational data which include Customer Relations Management (CRM) systems, messaging applications,\r\ndesktop data, other enterprise sources, and the lack of common structure in the associated data models.\r\n<br>\r\n3. Data-oriented methodology drives efficient Relationship Capital Management (RCM).\r\nIntelligent analysis has a significant impact on the value of an RCM system. At later stages of deployment,\r\nefficient network path analysis delivers higher close rates and shorter sales cycles. At early stages of deployment, efficient analysis dramatically reduces spam in the system that can undercut broad enterprise adoption.\r\n<br>\r\n4. RCM analytics power 3rd party applications.\r\nThe Visible Path platform is designed to enhance and extend existing enterprise applications. The value of the platform is derived from proprietary modules that have been developed by Visible Path to manage the quantity and complexity of data required to deliver effective application level functionality.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThis talk focuses on the network analysis aspects of VisiblePath's software.","bio":"","time":"18:00:00","location":"Wells Library 001"},

What is less remarkable about the hysteria is the depth of the analysis associated with the facts surrounding the relative positions of each company in the war.  To quote Sun Tzu, “All warfare is based on deception.”  The same holds true in many instances of the protracted litigation between Apple and Samsung. A variety of published articles paints Apple’s patent portfolio in a very strong position. For example, IEEE Spectrum ran an article in 2011 claiming that Apple had the most powerful patent portfolio in consumer electronics.  While such a claim is rather broad and encompassing of an industry that comprises a variety of products beyond cellular telephones and portable electronic devices, is there truth to what IEEE published or are the claims unsubstantiated rhetoric? Granted, Apple generates remarkable revenues and profits with its market offerings. However, does this strength relate to Apple’s core patent portfolio or from other IP types, such as its trademark or copyright portfolios. This presentation walks the observer through the claims of Apple’s patent portfolio power through several tests, especially in the context of the ongoing litigation with Samsung. The observer is left to evaluate whether the empirically observed macro patent-related actions of Apple and Samsung differ from what publishes in the media and in the voluminous filings regarding the Apple and Samsung litigation.","bio":"Mike Pellegrino is the Founder and President of Pellegrino & Associates, LLC.

Graph drawing algorithms aim to present such data in an effective and aesthetically appealing way. We describe map representations, which provide a way to visualize relational data with the help of conceptual maps as a data representation metaphor. While graphs often require considerable effort to comprehend, a map representation is more intuitive, as most people are familiar with maps and ways to interact with them via zooming and panning. Map-based visualization allows us to explicitly group clusters of related vertices as \"countries\" and to present additional information with contour and heatmap overlays. We consider map representations of the DBLP bibliography server. Words and phrases from paper titles are the cities in the map, and countries are created based on word and phrase similarity, calculated using co-occurrence. With the help of heatmaps, we can visualize the profile of a particular conference or journal over a base map of all computer science. Similarly, we can create heatmap profiles for individual researchers or research groups such as a department. Alternatively, a specific journal or conference can be used to generate the base map and then a series of heatmap overlays can show the evolution of research topics in the field over the years. As before, individual researchers or research groups can be visualized using heatmap overlays but this time over the journal or conference base map. Finally,  visual abstracts can be generated from research papers, providing a snapshot view of the topics in the paper.

Working with artists, engineers and scientists, the research collective combines the crafts of lightweight textile structures, dense arrays of distributed computer controls with machine learning, and artificial-life chemistry.  New architectural installations within the collaboration feature dense reticulated grottos with breathing, reactive, near-living qualities. Thin layers of hovering filters are tuned for delicate kinetic and chemical responses in the form of expanded physiologies, beckoning and sharing space with viewers. <br><br>\r\nThe presentation will suggest that conception of buildings can move from classical ideas of a static world of closed boundaries toward the expanded physiology and dynamic form of a metabolism. The architecture of historical Humanism encouraged stripped surfaces supporting free human action. Yet need we say that the boundaries of my body lie only at our skins and that the boundaries of a building must be defined by an enclosing envelope? My clothing floats and ripples outward. Fluxing heat and cold cloaks me. The systems that appear within life-giving forests and jungles seem opposite to the rigid, stable enclosures of classically defined building.  Instead of valuing resistance and closure, design for thermal exchange could result in new form-languages based on maximum interaction. Architecture could be founded on adaptation and uncertainty where acquiring and shedding heat play in uneven cycles. The densely layered forms of a jungle are often made of diffusive, deeply interwoven materials that expand and interact with their surroundings. The kind of diffusive forms seen in reticulated snowflakes and the microscopic manifolds of mitochondria have a common form-language of radical exfoliation. Their increased surface areas can make their reaction-surfaces potent.  These kinds of forms offer delicacy, resonance and resilience. <br><br>\r\nWrit large, these forms speak of involvement with the world. A new city designed to easily handle unstable conditions of shedding heat and cooling  and then rapidly warming up and collecting heat again might well look like a hybrid forest where each building is made from dense layers of ivy-like filters and multiple overlapping layers of porous openings. A building system using an expanded range of reticulated screens and canopies is implied, constructed from minutely balanced filtering layers that can amplify and guide convective currents encircling internal spaces. Within this renewed city fabric, the thermal plumes surrounding clusters of human occupants offer a new form of energy that could  be ingested, and diffused, and celebrated.   \r\n","bio":"<b>Philip Beesley</b>, MRAIC OAA RCA, is a practicing visual artist, architect, and Professor in Architecture at the University of Waterloo and Professor of Digital Design and Architecture & Urbanism at the European Graduate School. <br><br>\r\nHe serves as the Director for the Living Architecture Systems Group, and as Director for Riverside Architectural Press.

It often approached these problems – e.g., end-of-life decisions, the conduct of research in developing countries, genetic discrimination – either by applying moral principles to problems or by collecting empirical data from which informed policy could then be developed. Both approaches enjoyed success in the form of better hospital policies, improved federal research regulations, and a more informed public. But many emerging social problems are ‘wicked’ in the sense employed by Rittel and Weber (1973) where even agreement on the problem is elusive. The value of genomic science, Ebola preparedness, global conduct of health research are current examples. This talk will discuss two approaches being used by IU researchers to anticipate and address such wicked problems: (1) mapping translational science policy’s ‘valley of death’; (2) deploying an international global bioethics “collaboratory” designed to leverage the diverse strengths of investigators, publics, and governments.","bio":"Eric M.

An initial inspiration for visualizing the web was the science fiction writer William Gibson's vision of cyberspace, which he described in his novel <em>Neuromancer</em> as “... clusters and constellations of data. Like city lights, receding...”. In this early work I mapped hyperlink networks between organizational websites (e.g. political parties and social movement organizations), using tools developed for visualizing large scale networks such as the Internet architecture. My primary interest in social behavior on the web then led me to the field of social network analysis, with visualization approaches for identifying interesting properties of nodes in networks (for example, betweenness centrality) and networks themselves (for example, clustering). Social media provides new data sources for social network researchers, and I'll present some of my more recent work involving dynamic visualization of both network and text data from social media such as Facebook and Twitter. Throughout my talk I will also touch on more theoretically-oriented work, where colleagues and I have developed conceptual frameworks for analyzing networked social behavior online using visualization and statistical methods.","bio":"\tRobert Ackland is an Associate Professor with a joint appointment in the\r\n\tSchool of Sociology and the Centre for Social Research and Methods at the\r\n\tAustralian National University.

Despite the enormous societal costs of this incapacitating disorder, it is largely unknown how the likelihood of falling into a depressive episode can be assessed. One approach is to view the mood system as a dynamic network where emotions interact, such that reinforcing feedbacks between emotions could propagate a person into a disorder. As complex dynamical systems approach a tipping point, their dynamics tend to become dominated by a phenomenon known as critical slowing down. Using time series of autorecorded mood, we have shown that indicators of slowing down are also predictive of future transitions to and from depression. These results support the hypothesis that mood may have alternative stable states separated by tipping points, and suggest an approach for assessing the likelihood of transitions into and out of depression. However, these methods rely on self-assessment. Currently, we are investigating whether one could reliably monitor a person’s mood in individual Twitter timelines to find early warning signals of mood transitions such as depression.","bio":"Ingrid van de Leemput is a Visiting Research Scholar at the School of Informatics and Computing of IU.

The attractive advantages include (1) the low cost of facility, personnel, and supplies; (2) the fully human subject protection; (3) the amenability to perform parametric analysis, and (4) the direct human subject results. Radiological scanning and animal model experimentation cannot compete with these advantages to achieve similar results with the same investment. We have recently developed a unique computational platform, named InVascular, for patient-specific and non-invasive evaluation of in-vivo hemodynamics such as velocity, pressure, flow rate, wall-shear stress, and so on. InVascular integrates the advanced modeling technique of CFD based on patient’s clinical CT/MRI imaging information with the emerging GPU (graphic processing unit) parallel computing technology, which enable fast quantification of 4-D hemodynamics and massive numerical analysis to assess (1) the severity of vascular abnormalities and (2) the surgical benefits. This talk will focus on several ongoing clinical projects to demonstrate how engineering modeling and analysis can contribute to precise medicine for cardiovascular diseases. \r\n","bio":"Dr. Huidan (Whitney) Yu is an Associate Professor in Mechanical Engineering Department of Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI).
