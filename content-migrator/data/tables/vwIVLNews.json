They include Best Short Animation at the Albany FilmFest in Albany, CA, Best Animated Short at the Richmond International Film Festival in Richmond, VA, and the Documentary Shorts Award and Best Director Award at the Macon Film Festival in Macon, GA.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nYing-Fang Shen’s animated film depicts the ever-accelerating spread of information and communication over the course of human history. It’s perhaps fitting, then, that the film itself has been caught up in a similar momentum, with buzz about Humanexus and recognition for Shen building rapidly over the past year. <a href=\"http://yfshen.info/humanexus/\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to see the film's full list of accolades</a>. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n<em>Humanexus: Knowledge and Communication Through the Ages</em> is the product of a close collaboration between Shen and Indiana University professor Katy Börner, an expert in the theory and practice of data mining and information visualization who suggested the initial story and provided guidance and resources along the way. Viewers of <em>Humanexus</em> will be struck by the evocative relationship between Shen’s visuals and the rich aural landscape created by composer and sound designer Norbert Herber, a senior lecturer in Indiana University’s Department of Telecommunications. The result of their efforts tracks the evolution of human communication from cave scrawls to Twitter feeds. And while the film captures the giddy exhilaration of discovery and creation, it also strikes darker notes as it imagines the crucial point at which humanity finds itself, a decisive moment that pivots between a path of continued creativity and innovation and one of information overload and message breakdown. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nUltimately, <em>Humanexus</em> argues that the question of “What kind of future do we want?” is one that each of us has the power to address. To begin engaging with the issues raised by this provocative and visually striking work, <a href=\"http://youtu.be/K2A5XYvpPUk\" target=\"_blank\">watch the trailer</a>.

In 2010, more than 15,000 researchers peer-reviewed more than 55,000 proposals.  I think we can all agree that the current process is expensive and time-consuming. Now, the authors of a new article propose a new system that they believe will save us lots of time, money and trouble. The article is called “Collective allocation of science funding: from funding agencies to scientific agency,” by Johan Bollen (of the Twitter-predicts-stock market fame), David Crandall, Damion Junk, Ying Ding and Katy Börner.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nBasically, the authors would like to give each scientist (they focus on the U.S., but I suppose the system would work in other countries) a certain amount of money for research, of which she or he will have to send a percentage to other scientists who do research they consider funding-worthy.  Every researcher gets the same amount, no matter which institute she resides in, from the government. However, the sum she gets from other researchers will depend on her skills and performance as a researcher.  The authors give the following example; suppose every senior researcher in the US gets 100,000$ each year and a certain researcher received, in addition, 200,000$ from other researchers. She’s obligated to give 50%, or 150,000$ to other researchers, and save the rest for her own research. It’ll save lots of time and money that are now spent on writing proposals and peer-reviewing.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n<strong>The simulation</strong><br/>\r\n\r\nThe authors conducted a simulation using citations as proxy for fund distribution. They extracted 37 million academic articles from Thomson-Reuters’ Web of science for the years 1992-2010, which contained 770 million references overall.  Then they extracted out of more than 4 million authors those who, in the years 2000-2010, authored at least one article per year. The overall number of names was 867,872. They counted for each pair of researchers the number of citations they exchanged each year (1992-2010) and also retrieved records of 109,919 unique scientists who received 347,364 grants from the NIH and the NSF.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThe simulation began with a budget of 100,000$ for each author, and assumed that the amount each researcher would allocate would be in proportion to the times they cited other researchers during the 5 years before the simulation. Of course, it’s a proxy – researchers wouldn’t necessarily allocate funds to the same researchers they cite.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThen, the authors matched names based on first, last names and middle initials with the NSF and NIF funding records. 65,610 names matched, and they compared the actual funding for 2000-2010 to the funding predicted. The correlations were R = 0.268 (Pearson) and Spearman p=0.300.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThe authors emphasize that their proposal funds people rather than projects, which allows researchers more freedom than the current system. They suggest that perhaps researchers would be forbidden to contribute to their close collaborators, advisors and so forth, and that funding decisions would remain secret. I don’t know if those suggestions can stop researchers from creating “research cartels” where two researchers or more exchange funding, but we’ll cross that bridge if and when we get there.  This is one way to turn the “citation economy” into an actual, money-based one. Bollen predicted in his 14th International Society of Scientometrics and Infometrics Conference (ISSI) keynote that prominent researchers would become funding agencies themselves. Imagine a world with way less grant proposals to write!  It’s an intriguing concept, but I doubt governments would allow it (JUST GIVE THEM MONEY??!!)\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nJohan Bollen, David Crandall, Damion Junk, Ying Ding, & Katy Boerner (2013).

She used the multimedia and software platform Adobe Flash to create a two-dimensional animation that she describes as a collection of memory pieces organized according to time sequences but selectively pieced together in a fashion similar to how human memory works.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nIn addition to the film being viewed at three different Cannes venues, the AVIFF-Art Film Festival on May 20 will host a 90-minute live interview with Börner, the producer, and Herber, the sound artist, as they also present <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfSgBtwjIzU\" target=\"_blank\">“The Making of Humanexus.”</a>\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n“Scholarly papers, books and large-scale visualizations that explain patterns and trends in scholarly communication can help us see our world with new eyes,” Börner said. “The Humanexus film aims to make us feel the enormous progress and associated challenges so that we change our actions toward more sustainable futures.” \r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nFunded by the National Science Foundation, “Humanexus” allowed Herber to explore the film’s theme through the sounds of communication technologies, from Indiana limestone to analog circuits, a 56K modem and computer startup chimes, all of which were processed and layered in various ways to create a unique sonic reflection of the devices and networks portrayed in Shen’s animation.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n\"I have attended screenings in Bloomington and at other universities, and the film is always received well. Colleagues here at IU tell me that 'Humanexus' has made a tremendous impact on their students,” Herber said. “I am very curious to see how it affects the broad audience I hope to find at Cannes. 'Humanexus' was intended to start conversations; that's what I'm looking forward to most of all.\"\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n<b>Related Links</b><br>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2A5XYvpPUk&feature=youtu.be\" target=\"_blank\">Humanexus: The Trailer</a><br>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ_bYc9tLrc\" target=\"_blank\">Meet the animator: Ying-Fang Shen</a>"},

It involves 70 map makers from around the globe, Börner said.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n“As an engineer, I like to build things. I like to make things,” Börner said. “Typically as a professor at a college, you don’t get to make things. You just publish things.”\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThe maps covered diverse topics — from movie character interactions to international priorities, as inferred from Wikipedia searches by country.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nOne of the maps focused on different styles of manga art based on shading and stylization of the page. The map can be used to see what areas of manga are more popular and what areas have yet to be created.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThe manga art map was part of a series geared toward children.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nBörner said that by presenting the information in maps, this scientific data can become available and accessible to a much wider range of people, including kids as young as 12.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n“This data was meant for a very scientific audience, and now it’s meant for my mom and kids,” Börner said. “It’s for anyone.”\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nAnother map, called “U.S. Mood Variations Inferred from Twitter,” showed what regions of the country were feeling on a typical day. The scientists used combinations of terms from tweets to infer what mood the user was feeling.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThe Science Café series is free and open to the public.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThe event was in the upstairs room of Finch’s Brasserie.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThere were about 20 people in attendance eating at small tables and calling out questions whenever one came to mind.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nAlex Straiker was one of the founders of the Science Café series in Bloomington.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nHe said he saw his first Science Café event in Seattle and was excited about bringing the series to Bloomington.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n“We have the resources, we have the faculty, we have a lot of scientists and researchers,” Straiker said. “Bloomington is not huge, but there’s enough of a community here. The idea is to share with community and to build a bridge with the community and the rest of the public.”\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nHarold Ogren and his wife, Denise, are regular members of the audience at the Science Café.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nHarold is a former physics professor at IU and was part of the team of international scientists who discovered the Higgs boson particle.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n“Most of the talks are very interesting. It’s also a good opportunity to come out and have a great pizza,” Ogren said.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThe next Science Café will be Jan. 29.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n“This is a really nice resource for those who may not be specialists in science,” Theriault said."},

But there are virtually no sets of data — about chaps or anything else — that cannot be mapped, although sometimes a visually appealing map can hide as much as it reveals. This is the message of the exhibition 'Places and Spaces: Mapping Science' (<a href=\"http://scimaps.org\" target=\"_blank\">scimaps.org</a>), which can be seen <a href=\"http://ivl.cns.iu.edu/km/exhibit/2007-rudy-nyhs-nyc/nyhs.html\" target=\"_blank\">at the New York Hall of Science</a> until 25 February, after which it will tour the United States, Japan and Europe.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nCurated by Katy Börner and Julie Smith of Indiana University, the exhibition contains a judicious selection of early and modern maps that lay out in various ways how historic cultures have charted the configuration of the Earth and the heavens. There are also specialist maps showing, for example, the distribution of telegraphic linkages, exports and poverty. The charts of scientific papers and patents by region are especially revealing, the latter showing the globe grotesquely morphed by 'fat' zones of high innovative activity.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nRelationships between 'chaps' are also mapped, with networks of scientists and citations to the fore. Scientific disciplines are laid out according to their apparent relationships, and historical episodes are charted over time and space, most notably the discovery of DNA. Internet activity is plotted both architecturally and dynamically.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nAs the entities in the charts become more conceptual, the challenges become more complex and ultimately intractable. One set of juxtapositions in two dimensions necessarily precludes others that may be equally valid. An attempt to devise a two-dimensional distribution of geographical terms ends up by separating space in its political dimension from urban planning, which cannot be right.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe non-topographical mapping seems distinctively modern. But one of the most effective statistical maps is also the earliest in the exhibition. In 1869, the retired French engineer Charles Joseph Minard produced a remarkable <a href=\"http://scimaps.org/maps/map/napoleons_march_to_m_9/\" target=\"_blank\">map of Napoleon's catastrophic invasion of Russia</a>. It has hardly been surpassed for visual efficacy, and was acclaimed by the pioneer of 'cinematographic' photography, Etienne-Jules Marey, for its \"brutal eloquence\".\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe basis of Minard's map (shown here) is a straightforward chart of the territory traversed by the French army in the winter of 1812–13, from Kowno (Kaunas) on the left to Moscow on the right. The width of the tinted strip represents the number of soldiers in the French army as it progresses eastwards. The plot doesn't thicken — quite the reverse in fact, beginning with a rearguard of 33,000 men branching off to remain at Polotsk. A series of abrupt falls then brings the company of 422,000 down to 100,000 by the time they reach Moscow.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe black line represents the retreating body of soldiers after they had sacked the Russian capital. The diminishing band is temporarily boosted from 20,000 to 50,000 as the rearguard rejoins, but at the River Berezina a Russian attack triggers a shambles. A stark black step graphically records the extent of the disaster.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nEven more remarkably, Minard also charts one of the causal factors, the severe drop of temperature, on the army's return march during November and early December. By 6 December it had reached -30 °C and the army had been scythed down to a tiny rump of just 12,000 men.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nMinard's map is both a vivid graphic and a tool for analysis, and forms the basis for further questions, such as the onset of infections, food deprivation, failure of equipment, and shortage of ammunition. Minard's map lays down a series of challenges in lucidity, functionality and potentiality that few since have fully met.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nAll this was accomplished by Minard after the age of 70. His last act was to publish the Napoleonic map in juxtaposition to one showing the Roman emperor Hadrian's disastrous losses on his return trip across the Alps from his northern expedition. It was designed to demonstrate the enduring human cost of war."},

The PHI will create a collaboration with the IU School of Medicine, IUPUI, and multiple entities on the IU Bloomington campus, including the <a href=\"http://www.soic.indiana.edu/index.html\">School of Informatics and Computing</a>. The goal: Nothing short of curing cancer.</p><br><p>How’s that for grand?</p><br>\r\n\r\n<p>The PHI proposal features a number of bold goals.</p><br>\r\n\r\n<p>“Cure one cancer, cure one childhood cancer, and make progress in one chronic disease and one neurodegenerative disease,” said <a href=\"https://www.soic.indiana.edu/all-people/profile.html?profile_id=278\">Predrag Radivojac</a>, a professor of computer science who is spearheading SoIC’s involvement with PHI. “The cancer we will work on will be multiple myeloma. The childhood cancer will be Fanconi anemia, and for chronic disease, it looks like it is going to be diabetes. For the neurodegenerative, it looks like it is going to be Alzheimer’s. Final decisions depend on the quality of currently available data in the IU’s Electronic Medical Records, which we are currently analyzing.”</p><br>\r\n\r\n<p>The plan is to use precision medicine to battle disease at a genomic level. Precision medicine focuses on the treatment of disease by taking into account patients’ individual differences in environment, genes, and lifestyle. Using those factors, treatments could be developed to attack disease at a much more precise level than in the past.</p><br>\r\n\r\n<p>The PHI proposal included an example of precision medicine in action. It cited a case in which a 62-year-old man was diagnosed with an aggressive form of thyroid cancer, with a median survival of three months, at a stage of advanced disease in the neck and metastases to the lung. Chemotherapy was not having an impact, and the patient wasn’t expected to live beyond a few weeks. After precision genomics tests were conducted, his tumor was found to have a particular genetic mutation that was then treated with an inhibitor that slowed the disease’s progression. He also was found to have another immunosuppressive issue that was allowing the disease to spread rapidly. Treatment for that problem led to a complete radiographic remission, and the patient has remained disease-free for more than a year.</p><br>\r\n\r\n<p>Radivojac, who has spent his career working in bioinformatics and genomic medicine, couldn’t be more excited for the opportunity to be a part of the initiative.</p><br>\r\n\r\n<p>“This was one of the main objectives for the bioinformatics field from the get-go,” Radivojac said. “At the time, we didn’t have a name for it. It was always supposed to be something to improve human health. The term ‘precision medicine’ was coined just a few years ago, and we, as a community, seemed so well-positioned for that.”</p><br>\r\n\r\n<p>How can SoIC help a medical initiative? It will take a collaborative effort. Faculty with ties to bioinformatics, health informatics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, security, high-performance computing, and a host of other areas will come together to do their part.</p><br>\r\n\r\n<p>The size and scope of the PHI puts SoIC in a unique position. A number of schools invest in precision medicine, but those investments are usually focused on medical schools. The PHI approach will allow experts from multiple fields to come together for a common goal, and the breadth of research at SoIC is what made the School’s involvement possible.</p><br>\r\n\r\n<p>“We also wanted to do certain things that we think SoIC can drive with precision medicine,” Radivojac said. “You can think of this as a data-driven approach. We would like to hypothesize causes of disease and work with doctors or experimental scientists to validate that. Sometimes SoIC will be serving the experimentalists, and sometimes it will be leading them. We are trying to balance those roles.”</p><br>\r\n\r\n<p>Radivojac said that although the PHI is focused on curing disease, the SoIC is realistic about its role.</p><br>\r\n\r\n<p>“We alone cannot cure diseases,” Radivojac said. “We are a School of Informatics and Computing. But we can boost the basic research component of this initiative. We will first acquire patients’ health records, then we will have their genomes, then we will collect data for wearable devices so we can collect their data on a regular basis over a number of years. From medical records to genomes to wearables, it will give us something that hasn’t been done yet, even if its scale is 1,500-2,000 people. There are a lot of unknowns, but there are a lot of studies we can do on these types of patients where we can look at the progress on maintaining their disease, whether it grows worse or gets better, and try to correlate the various genomic and lifestyle features through studies and surveys.”</p><br>\r\n\r\n<p>The PHI will receive up to $40 million overall to fund its work, and it will lead to dozens of faculty hires and research involvement from graduate students. It all adds up to a major undertaking, one that features a lot of responsibility but will reinforce SoIC’s reputation as a cutting-edge leader in research.</p><br>\r\n\r\n<p>“This is a once in a lifetime opportunity,” Radivojac said. “There might be other types of challenges that would be grand, but I doubt it could be bigger than this for us. We’ve been waiting and preparing for this kind of opportunity.”</p><br>\r\n\r\n<p><em>SoIC faculty involved in the Precision Health Initiative include:</em></p><br><p><a href=\"https://www.soic.indiana.edu/all-people/profile.html?profile_id=2\">Katy Börner</a>, distinguished professor of information science<br><br><a href=\"https://www.soic.indiana.edu/all-people/profile.html?profile_id=181\">Kay Connelley</a>, associate professor of informatics<br><br><a href=\"https://www.soic.indiana.edu/all-people/profile.html?profile_id=203\">Geoffrey Fox</a>, distinguished professor of intelligent systems engineering<br><br><a href=\"https://www.soic.indiana.edu/all-people/profile.html?profile_id=216\">Matthew Hahn</a>, professor of informatics and biology<br><br><a href=\"https://www.soic.indiana.edu/all-people/profile.html?profile_id=261\">Steven Myers</a>, associate professor of computer science and informatics<br><br><a href=\"https://www.soic.indiana.edu/all-people/profile.html?profile_id=262\">Sriraam Natarajan</a>, associate professor of computer science and informatics<br><br><a href=\"https://www.soic.indiana.edu/all-people/profile.html?profile_id=278\">Predrag Radivojac</a>, professor of computer science<br><br><a href=\"https://www.soic.indiana.edu/all-people/profile.html?profile_id=291\">Cenk Sahinalp</a>, professor of computer science<br><br><a href=\"https://www.soic.indiana.edu/all-people/profile.html?profile_id=300\">Katie Siek</a>, associate professor of informatics<br><br><a href=\"https://www.soic.indiana.edu/all-people/profile.html?profile_id=308\">Haixu Tang</a>, professor of informatics and computing<br><br><a href=\"https://www.soic.indiana.edu/all-people/profile.html?profile_id=360\">Martha White</a>, assistant professor of computer science<br><br><a href=\"https://www.soic.indiana.edu/all-people/profile.html?profile_id=325\">Yuzhen Ye</a>, associate professor of informatics and computing</p>\r\n"},

Over the past 10 years, the information visualization specialist has led in the curation of 100 maps created by 236 mapmakers -- from 68 cities in 16 countries -- who represented 30 different scientific disciplines.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe project -- creating 10 new maps each year that take a unique macroscopic look at some form of scientific or human activity -- began its formal curtain call last week at the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Fla., on a spectacular note: It is the first time all 100 maps have been on display at one time.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nFrom broad research topics to niches and novelties, the maps include:\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"middle\">\r\n<li><a href=\"http://scimaps.org/mapdetail/hurricanes__tropical_151\" target=\"_blank\">Locations and intensities of hurricanes</a> over the past 160 years</li>\r\n<li>Hands-on <a href=\"http://scimaps.org/iteration/8\" target=\"_blank\">science maps for kids</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://scimaps.org/mapdetail/ecological_footprint_42\" target=\"_blank\">The environment</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://scimaps.org/mapdetail/history_of_science_f_132\" target=\"_blank\">The history of science fiction</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://scimaps.org/mapdetail/examining_the_evolut_41\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. patents</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://scimaps.org/mapdetail/finding_research_lit_126\" target=\"_blank\">Research literature on autism</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://scimaps.org/mapdetail/movie_narrative_char_149\" target=\"_blank\">Movie character interaction charts, including \"Lord of the Rings\"</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://scimaps.org/mapdetail/state_of_the_polar_b_152\" target=\"_blank\">The state of the polar bea</a>r</li>\r\n<li>A visualization of <a href=\"http://scimaps.org/mapdetail/visualizing_bible_cr_125\" target=\"_blank\">cross-references in the Bible</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIf hung side by side, the maps would stretch the length of two football fields. Taking just 30 minutes to talk about each map and its makers -- which Börner believes is the minimum time it takes to tell all the stories and unravel all the insights that come with each of the maps -- would fill 50 hours.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nCoordinated from IU’s Cyberinfrastructure for Network Science Center, which Börner directs, annual iterations of the collection have been displayed at more than 250 venues in 23 countries and on six continents. From the New York Public Library to the National Science Library of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, as a mobile exhibit on a passenger train across Germany called The Science Express and at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington, D.C., “Places and Spaces: Mapping Science” has served as an ambassador communicating the structure, dynamics and beauty of the science and technology landscape to audiences of all ages and from all walks of life.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nBörner, IU’s Victor H. Yngve Professor of Information Science at the School of Informatics and Computing, said the maps were designed to help viewers make sense of the avalanche of data being generated by scientists today by placing it into a visual, tangible context suited to serve as an aid to navigating, understanding and communicating knowledge.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n“Maps have guided mankind’s explorations for centuries,\" she said. \"In the information age, key opportunities for discovery and innovation reside in knowledge and expertise spaces, and maps of science help us navigate, manage, understand and exploit these spaces.”\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nWhile search engines can retrieve facts from an ocean of data, they cannot answer larger questions about the seascape as a whole, she said. “How big is this ocean? How can we navigate to the useful islands of knowledge? How is knowledge interlinked on a global scale? In which areas is it worth investing time, effort and compassion?”\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nBörner kicked off the latest exhibit with a keynote address at University of Miami’s School of Architecture, which served as the lead-in to an entire semester of lectures at the campus about visualizing data and its confluences with the arts, sciences and everyday life. Following the University of Miami exhibition, \"Places and Spaces\" will travel to Northwestern University in Chicago, where it will remain on display for five months.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nFirst shown at the Annual Meeting of the Association of American Geographers in April 2005, the exhibit’s home has always been at Indiana University. During the past two years, editor and co-curator Todd Theriault and designer Samuel Mills, both at the Cyberinfrastructure for Network Science Center on the IU Bloomington campus, worked closely with the mapmakers to prepare the maps for a general audience, refining the designs to make them easier on the eyes and more intuitive for the lay person.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe large-scale, high-resolution maps were printed in rich color by printer and photographer Kendall Reeves of Spectrum Studio in Bloomington. Custom furniture builder Dolan Cleverley, also of Bloomington, designed and fabricated the shipping crates in which the maps and interactive elements of the exhibit travel. Lisel Record, the exhibit manager at the Cyberinfrastructure for Network Science Center, is responsible for venue acquisition and logistics surrounding shipment of the many crates and the display of the exhibit in venues around the globe.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nSeveral IU faculty and staff members were also among the mapmakers:\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"middle\">\r\n<li>David E. Polley, a social sciences librarian at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis' University Library, worked with Mills to create “<a href=\"http://scimaps.org/mapdetail/who_really_matters_i_157\" target=\"_blank\">Who Really Matters in the World</a> -- Leadership Networks in Different-Language Wikipedias.”</li>\r\n<li>IU graphic designer Michael J. Stamper was one of the collaborators on the “<a href=\"http://scimaps.org/mapdetail/knowledge_web_143\" target=\"_blank\">Knowledge Web</a>” map.</li>\r\n<li>Assistant professor of informatics Y.Y. Ahn collaborated on “<a href=\"http://scimaps.org/mapdetail/pulse_of_the_nation_153\" target=\"_blank\">Pulse of the Nation</a>,” a map of time-stamped mood variations across the U.S. based on Twitter use.</li>\r\n<li>Professor of geological sciences Michael W. Hamburger was an author of the “<a href=\"http://scimaps.org/mapdetail/tectonic_movements_a_23\" target=\"_blank\">Tectonic Movements and Earthquake Hazard Predictions</a>” map.</li>\r\n<li>Provost Professor of Psychological and Brain Sciences Olaf Sporns co-authored the “<a href=\"http://scimaps.org/mapdetail/the_human_connectome_115\" target=\"_blank\">Human Connectome</a>” map.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNow that 10 years have passed and 100 maps created, the exhibit team and an international advisory board will endeavor on Phase II of the exhibit: a focus on interactive tools and online services that empower users not only to read maps but to make their very own data visualizations and to use them in informed decision making. An <a href=\"http://ivmooc.cns.iu.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">information visualization massive open online course</a> that Börner will teach again in spring 2015 gives a first glimpse of the power of visualization to create actionable insights."},

The $7 million initiative will bring together many of  the university’s top minds to explore and embrace the challenge of understanding complex networks that underlie large-scale systems, including the environment, economics, technology and human health.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n“Today, more than ever before, exploring the connections and relationships among our most complex networks -- from the biological to the economic, political and social -- is paramount to solving humankind’s most critical and challenging questions,” IU Vice President for Research Jorge José said. “Through the formation of this new interdisciplinary, university-wide institute, which will reflect all of the major sectors of scientific research and will be supported by the university's robust technological infrastructure, Indiana University has positioned itself to become the leading global center for understanding the complicated structure and evolving dynamics of the systems that drive our society.” \r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nComplex networks are at the core of an ever more interconnected social, economic and technological planet, and their connectivity and dynamics underpin nearly all aspects of how these systems function. Networks can be associated with topics as diverse as cancer, schizophrenia, even the spreading of rumors, innovations or social unrest.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nEchoing the late IU Nobel Laureate Elinor Ostrom, who said, “When the world we are trying to explain and improve … is not well-described by a simple model, we must continue to improve our frameworks and theories so as to be able to understand complexity and not simply reject it,” José said that focusing on the interactions between huge numbers of system components -- be it in the brain or the global economy -- places the university at the forefront of shaping new paths for research and innovation.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThree faculty members named as founding co-directors helped lead the effort to create the institute: Distinguished Professor Bernice Pescosolido, Department of Sociology; Distinguished Professor Olaf Sporns, Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences; and Andrew Saykin, professor of radiology and imaging sciences and director of the Indiana Alzheimer Disease Center at the IU School of Medicine.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe institute will be unique in a number of ways: Affiliated researchers will represent multiple IU campuses and will come from medicine, the natural sciences, the social sciences and the humanities; in addition to being focused on networks, every project supported by the institute is required to be a collaboration, a reflection of the institute itself. Four research hubs currently form the core of IUNI -- Health and Health Care, Network Neuroscience, Science of Science and Social Network Science -- each with the capacity to engage and share data and other resources with one another. Outreach activities, workshops and conferences and efforts toward online network science education will add to the scope of IUNI activities.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe three-year initiative -- with an opportunity to renew for another three years -- will be supported by IU President Michael A. McRobbie's office, the offices of Provost and Executive Vice President Lauren Robel and Vice President for Research José, the College of Arts and Sciences, the School of Informatics and Computing, and the School of Medicine.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n“This new institute recognizes that we are all part of networks, and that these networks, ever evolving and changing, are inherently complex systems that present challenges to scientists across all fields,” Robel said. “With a contingent of over 100 scientists spanning all disciplines, the ties among network science researchers that already exist in the IU system are ripe for encouragement, with many new ones inevitable through support of IUNI.”\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nTo date, affiliated faculty from 26 different schools, departments and centers have either participated in development of IUNI or expressed an interest in participating in collaborative research through the institute. Faculty participating in the institute represent one of the broadest and deepest cadres of researchers studying networks, including the College of Arts and Sciences departments of physics, psychological and brain sciences, statistics, sociology and geography; the School of Informatics and Computing at IU Bloomington; the School of Medicine; the School of Public Health-Bloomington; the Fairbanks School of Public Health at IUPUI; and centers already focused on different aspects of complex networks, such as the Indiana Center for Systems Biology and Personalized Medicine at IUPUI and the Digital Science Center at IU Bloomington.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe three co-directors applauded the announcement.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n“IUNI will provide novel concepts, tools and training to address tomorrow’s challenges,” Saykin said. “We appreciate the university’s vision in supporting team science to elucidate the complex networks that comprise the human genome, brain interconnectivity, health care systems and society -- creating a truly exciting and unprecedented opportunity.”\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nPescosolido described the nature of the institute as a reflection of the very work that will be conducted there, an exercise in synergy.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n“We live in a world where society and the problems we face represent a web of interconnections,” Pescosolido said. “When we think we have fixed one part of it, unforeseen complications arise elsewhere as unintended consequences. These are complex, connected interactions that demand a transdisciplinary approach that brings the expertise across the landscape of science to the table.”\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nSporns added that the new institute recognizes the natural strengths already present at IU.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n“By design, when it comes to our expertise in complex systems, the whole is greater than the sum of the parts,” he said. “With the new synergies that will be created through IUNI, we have the unique opportunity to break the mold and approach the many challenges we face in science and society from a fresh and broad perspective.”"},

All three are a part of the IU Cyberinfrastructure for Network Science (CNS) Center: Dr. Bӧrner is the CNS Center founding director, Scott Weingart is a current SLIS doctoral student, and Ted Polley is a SLIS alumnus (MIS/MLS’12) and Research Assistant Staff at CNS.\r\nThe Information Visualization MOOC (IVMOOC) has over 2,000 registered students. The course designers wanted to have student teams work with real world clients. (<a href=\"http://ivmooc.cns.iu.edu/ivmooc_clientprojects.html\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to see the list of client project</a>)\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nTo support this functionality, the implemented a Drupal Forum, which became an integral tool to interconnect students to each other and to external clients. A grant from Google supported part of the costs to develop the work.\r\nThe following press release (prepared by Robyn Im at Google, with Mike Widner and Katy Bӧrner, SLIS) provides more detail about how Drupal Forums were integrated with Course Builder to support the IVMOOC at Indiana University.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n<strong>Integrating Drupal with Course Builder</strong><br/><br/>\r\nWhen Indiana University needed to create a specialized forum, registration, and profile management system for their Information Visualization MOOC (IVMOOC) on Course Builder, they turned to Drupal.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nMike Widner, the Drupal developer on the project, used contributed Drupal 7 modules with his own custom created module. These modules powered the IVMOOC forums, client profiles, and student groups and were integrated with Course Builder. The Janrain Engage module allowed multiple third party sign in options. However, since all students used Google accounts, third-party signons other than Google login were disabled. Drupal also has its own user accounts and login page (which Janrain Engage leverages) but having both signons could have confused students. So Mike created a small, custom module that hides the user registration, login, and password recovery options, thereby giving students a single login ID using their Google accounts.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nIndiana University also wanted third party clients to engage with students to create projects. This was enabled through a special forum that allowed students and third party clients to interact with each other without restricting access to the IVMOOC team. The forums used Advanced Forums and several custom Views to allow students to sort forum topics by the number of votes each received. In order not to expose everyone's email addresses, which otherwise would be their default username, the Real Name module overwrote all username strings with the names students provided. Voting on topics was via the Vote Up/Down modules. Custom content types showed client profiles, group details, and student profiles.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nOrganic Groups allowed students to self-organize into project groups. Custom behaviors based on Rules automatically created sub-forums for each new student group where members discussed their clients' projects. There is a View of student profiles that can be filtered by student competencies, skills, and group membership. All of the customizations that make up the core IVMOOC Forums functionality were packaged as Features for easy deployment.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n<strong>Drupal Modules Used:</strong>\r\n<ul class=\"middle\">\r\n<li>Advanced Forum</li>\r\n<li>Features</li>\r\n<li>Janrain Engage</li>\r\n<li>Organic groups</li>\r\n<li>Real Name</li>\r\n<li>Rules</li>\r\n<li>Views</li>\r\n<li>Vote Up/Down</li>\r\n</ul>"},

Yngve Professor of Information Science at IU Bloomington's School of Library and Information Service, sits on a panel with Sir Tim Berners-Lee, founder of the World Wide Web and the current director of the WWW Foundation. The topic, \"The Global Design Challenge,\" is a session designed to provide insights on the growing importance of design and to share ideas on how it can foster change in addressing a range of global issues.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n\"My perspective is most relevant for understanding and managing complexity using data mining and visualization,\" she said of the panel session that also includes Eben Bayer, the founder of Ecovative Design, and Zhang Xin, CEO and co-founder of SOHO China. The panel is chaired by Paola Antonelli, director of research and development at The Museum of Modern Art, New York.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, Jan. 24, Börner gives a 45-minute talk titled \"Visualizing What We Know,\" while using the World Economic Forum's Davos BetaZone, a studio room that uses new technology to visualize innovations at the annual meeting on a nearly 24-square-meter display wall. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nFinally, on Saturday, Jan. 26, she participates on a second panel discussion, this one on the topic \"Reinforcing Critical Infrastructure With Cyber Experts.\" The panel includes technology leaders from the Georgia Institute of Technology, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Carnegie Mellon University. Börner will speak specifically on the topic, \"Dangerous Visualizations: Big Data Is Watching You.\"\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nBörner said \"Big Data\" is the new definitive source of competitive advantage across all industries, yet also the raw material for fraud, identity theft and a generation of dangerous visualizations that could reveal sensitive information impacting an entity's reputation and security. As \"Big Data\" is exposed, interlinked, mined and visualized for broader consumption, it will be important to have norms and policies in place that ensure high data quality, best analysis and visualization workflows, and continuous improvement of legal regulations.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n\"The key takeaways for the presentation will be that 'Big Data' also means big trouble, that advanced data mining and visualization tools can help prevent abuse, and that proper norms, policies and legal regulations are key,\" she said.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nBörner said she was invited to participate at the World Economic Forum after being recommended by a peer, and that she welcomed the opportunity to continue her efforts at informing how insightful information visualizations can aid a variety of users, from elementary-age school children to the CEOs of the world's largest corporations.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n\"The WEF is unique in that it brings together academic, business, political and other leaders of society to discuss and shape regional and global agendas in science and industry,\" she said. \"Over the last 10 years, we have worked closely with researchers, companies and science policy makers to develop data mining and visualization tools that help improve daily decision-making. I am looking forward to introducing our plug-and-play macroscope tools, visualizations from the Mapping Science exhibit and the information visualization MOOC to an even broader audience.\"\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThe World Economic Forum annual meeting is a five-day, invitation-only annual event that brings together some 2,500 top business leaders, international political leaders, selected intellectuals and journalists to discuss the most pressing issues facing the world, including health and the environment. This year the annual meeting can be followed through a variety of social media tools, including Twitter, Facebook, live and video webcasts and blogs."},

This spans what multimedia artists are making and how also they are incorporating some of the most advanced technologies. How such trends between art ideation and technological invention are influencing the made object and the sensorium by which video and new media art is received, continually puts Currents at the forefront of new media art exhibition.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n“One of the things we’re doing this year is expanding the multimedia performance aspect quite a bit,” said Frank Ragano, co-founder with Mariannah Amster of Parallel Studios, which organizes and runs Currents.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nOpening night (June 13th) events put the spotlight on Railyard Arts District where the show’s headquarters of El Museo Cultural of Santa Fe hosts the plethora of media work, while performative and time-based projections occur in Railyard Park, after gallery exhibits open earlier in the evening at <a href=\"http://zanebennettgallery.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Zane Bennett Contemporary Art</a> and <a href=\"http://davidrichardgallery.com/\" target=\"_blank\">David Richard Gallery</a>. (A full schedule of events, plus a list of program partners as well as sponsors can be found on the <a href=\"http://currentsnewmedia.org/festivals/currents-2014/\" target=\"_blank\">website sidebar</a>.) As is customary of the festival, the Digital Dome at Institute of American Indian Arts is home to a subset of programming for which viewers can recline in chairs and experience the sensurround of dome projection work. Shuttle vans will travel between the Railyard and IAIA on the first two Saturdays of Currents (June 14 and 21).\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nEven if the show leans heavily to newer and newest technology, “what drives each of our shows is the artists,” Ragano said.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nOscar Raby is a Chilean born multimedia designer who began a career in advertising  before founding one of Chile’s most prominent artistic collectives, O-inc. in 2001. Raby has lived in Australia since 2008. His work will employ new “oculus rift” technology offering visitors the virtual reality goggles. The 10-year-old Chicago-based collaborative, <a href=\"http://www.luftwerk.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Luftwerk</a>, is interested in fully immersing viewers in a projected experience of color and light. The curators of the festival strive for mixes of emerging and established artists, and in seeking to change up their own program, this year’s performative aspect focuses on a major event on June 20th at the Lensic. That will be when <a href=\"http://www.lightsurgeons.com/\" target=\"_blank\">the Light Surgeons</a> perform <a href=\"http://supereverything.net/the-light-surgeons/\" target=\"_blank\">“Super Everything.”</a>  (For tickets, <a href=\"https://tickets.ticketssantafe.org/single/PSDetail.aspx?psn=795\" target=\"_blank\">visit this link</a>.) The Light Surgeons are a group of audio-visual artists who operate as a multimedia production company in London. The live cinema aspect of the performance merges with a political theater sensibility, Ragano explained, and makes this work a new benchmark for Currents which hopes in future years to instigate a touring new media performance connected with the festival.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nVisiting Currents New Media Festival in the past has purveyed the reliable sense of new media work wanting to tease apart essence from effects and substance from appurtenance.  Inside the box-car like room sof El Museo Cultural you’re asked to sit, look straight ahead, look straight down, be hypnotized, engage in lucid dreaming, all the while that the ephemera of pixels present on screens or other projection surfaces purporting to alter flat to shaped — remembering that illusion in these new times is surely a condition that we can’t live without."},

The inaugural class of students will begin the program in January.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe new degree program capitalizes on the existing breadth of research and study at the school, with courses coming from computer science, informatics, information science, library science and statistics. There are two paths through the degree -- a technical path and a decision-maker path -- allowing students to easily customize the program to meet their professional goals.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n“The pace of data generation continues to escalate at unprecedented levels, and IU’s breadth and depth of faculty expertise in data science distinguishes our school and university,” Dean Bobby Schnabel said. “This program will produce well-prepared graduates who will provide a competitive advantage to companies and organizations across Indiana and throughout the nation.”\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe demand for big data jobs is a major driver behind the creation of the program. A 2011 McKinsey Global Institute report predicted huge demand in data science positions, projecting up to 1.8 million jobs in the United States in the next five years across all industries.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n“A high percentage of the school’s more than $18 million in annual research funding centers around big data, and our diverse faculty expertise in big data has shaped this degree,” said Geoffrey Fox, senior associate dean for research.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe 30-credit program is available on campus, online or in a blended version with online and in-residence components. The online option provides an affordable, flexible opportunity for working professionals, while the residential program provides physical access to the school’s world-class faculty, opportunities to participate in cutting-edge research, and immersion in the vibrant Bloomington campus.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe hybrid option allows students to take the first year of courses online and complete the second year on campus.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n“The hybrid option provides maximum flexibility for students,” said Howard Rosenbaum, associate dean for graduate studies. “This will be particularly appealing for students outside Indiana, especially international students.”\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nAdditional sequences will be available for those interested in specific domains, such as health, cybersecurity, life sciences and more.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nCourses will be offered in four broad areas:\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"middle\">\r\n<li><b>Data analysis and statistics</b>, which gives students skills to develop and extend algorithms, statistical approaches, and visualization techniques.</li>\r\n<li><b>Data lifecycle</b>, which helps students understand the data lifecycle, from digital birth to long-term preservation.</li>\r\n<li><b>Data management and infrastructure</b>, which teaches students to manage and support big data projects.</li>\r\n<li><b>Big data application domains</b>, which provides students with data analysis and decision-making experience in high-impact domain areas like health and security.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The master’s degree deepens the school’s reach in this area, building on the affordable online data science certificate program, which will enter its second year in January.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nVisit the school’s <a href=\"http://www.soic.indiana.edu/graduate/degrees/data-science/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Data Science degree site</a> for more information and application details for both programs.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<strong>Related Links</strong><br>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.soic.indiana.edu/graduate/degrees/data-science/\" target=\"_blank\">IU: Data science in demand</a><br>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.informatics.indiana.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">IU School of Informatics and Computing, Bloomington</a><br>\r\n<a href=\"http://soic.iupui.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">IU School of Informatics and Computing, IUPUI</a>"},

Cacioppo","date":"2007-09-01","description":"In an issue of the magazine <em>Scientific American, </em>the editors observed that “whenever we run articles on social topics, some readers protest that we should stick to ‘real’ science” (The Peculiar Institution, 2002, p. 8). You and I are confident about the scientific stature of psychology, but who in APS hasn’t felt the icy skepticism of a fellow traveler on a flight after you respond to the question, “What is your occupation?” You may therefore be pleasantly surprised by a scientometric study entitled “Mapping the Backbone of Science” (Boyack, Klavans, &amp; Borner, 2005). The article is must reading for deans who oversee scientific psychology departments. I will explain why shortly. But first, some background.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nIn the Middle Ages, theology and philosophy were a dynamic duo of hub disciplines around which the other sciences were organized. These two areas influenced thinking across the various fields of scholarship (Leydesdorff, 2006).\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThe past three centuries have seen unparalleled advances in science. During this time, there have been scientific theories of invisible forces operating with measurable effects, such as in the case of magnetism, gravity, and dark matter. Natural philosophy became identified with physics, which, with mathematics, took on the role of the hub discipline of science.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nScientific research during the past century has continued to accelerate in terms of quantity and impact. People may reminisce about the good old days, but thanks to science and technology the amount of total income spent on the necessities of food, clothing, and shelter dropped from 80 percent in 1901 to 50 percent in 2002/2003 (U.S. Department of Labor, 2006). The explosion in the number of scientists, scientific specializations, journals, and research articles over the past century has been just as extraordinary. Given these dramatic changes, are the sciences still organized around a central discipline or two? Has the rapid period of expansion produced several hub disciplines? Or have all the scientific disciplines matured independently and sufficiently such that there is no central, inherent overall structure in the sciences?\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nBoyack and colleagues sought to answer these and similar questions. Scientometric and bibliometric analyses have been in place to identify clusters of authors, papers, or references, but only recently have computing capabilities, computational algorithms, and visualization techniques emerged that permit the analysis of large-scale document datasets. Boyack and colleagues quantified the patterns of scientific influence within and across the sciences based on citation data from more than one million journal articles appearing in 7,121 natural and social sciences journals published in 2000. For a source of high-quality citation data, they turned to the Science Citation Index (SCI) and the Social Science Citation Index (SSCI). The use of the SCI and SSCI also made it possible to use individual journal articles, rather than entire journals, as the unit of analysis. Among the limitations of using the SCI and SSCI are that conference and workshop proceedings are not indexed and that non-English-language journals are less likely to be included.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nEight different approaches to quantifying citation patterns were used to ensure structural accuracy, where accuracy means that journals within the same subdiscipline were grouped together, and groups of journals that cite each other were close to each other. Additionally, new visualization techniques were used to generate a two-dimensional spatial map of the sciences based on each metric. Finally, the validity of these maps was compared using two different accuracy measures. The best measures converged on the landscape of scientific influence. The resulting mapping of science provides a visual depiction of where each scientific discipline is, what is around it, what its relationships are to its neighboring disciplines, and how strong its impact is on the neighboring disciplines.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThe results are presented in Figure 1. Not surprisingly, given scientific specialization over the past century, contemporary sciences no longer originate from a single source. Instead, seven hub sciences can be identified: mathematics, physics, chemistry, earth sciences, medicine, psychology, and the social sciences. Yes, psychology emerged as one of the hub disciplines of science!\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThe location of many of the disciplines has face validity as well. Electrical and nuclear engineering fall between mathematics and physics, chemical engineering and analytic chemistry fall between physics and chemistry, and statistics falls between mathematics and the social sciences. More interestingly here, public health, neuroscience, neurology, radiology, cardiology, and genetics are among the sciences that fall between psychology and medicine, whereas education and gerontology fall between psychology and the social sciences.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThe more insular the field, the closer a field will lie to the outside of the map. Those with many interdisciplinary linkages are more likely to lie toward the middle of the map. It is interesting, therefore, to note that psychiatry, law, political science, and economics all lie along the outside, whereas psychology is closer to the middle, reflecting its interdisciplinary nature. Another map depicting the linkages among scientific fields confirmed that psychology is a hub discipline — that is, a discipline in which scientific research is cited by scientists in many other fields. For instance, medicine draws from psychology most heavily through neurology and psychiatry, whereas the social sciences draw directly from most of the specialties within psychology.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nDuring a period in which our national leaders appear more likely to identify psychology with the work of Dr. Phil and Dr. Laura than with the thousands of scientists worldwide who make up the membership of the Association for Psychological Science, it is imperative that institutions of higher education make clear the centrality and influence of psychological science as well as the importance of maintaining and promoting its growth. Indeed, Boyack et al. (2005) noted: “Our interest in mapping science stems from a desire to understand the inputs, associations, flows, and outputs of the Science and Technology enterprise in a detailed manner that will help us guide that enterprise (or at least that portion of it operating in our institutions) in more fruitful directions” (p. 352). Most universities are organized along more traditional disciplinary boundaries, but decisions about both faculties and facilities could benefit from knowledge about the scientific disciplines that are especially central and influential. The results of Boyack et al. (2005) indicate that scientific contributions in psychology advance not only the discipline but many other scientific fields as well.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nI began this column with the observation by the editors of <em>Scientific American</em> that whenever they run articles on “social” science topics they receive protests from some readers who advise them to stick to real science. The editors of <em>Scientific American</em> went on to say that they seldom hear these complaints from working physical or biological scientists: “They are the first to point out that the natural universe, for all its complexity, is easier to understand than the human being. If social science seems mushy, it is largely because the subject matter is so difficult, not because humans are somehow unworthy of scientific inquiry” (The Peculiar Institution, 2002, p. 8). The importance and centrality of psychological science may not be fully understood by politicians, but the evidence is clear: The mapping of science shows psychology to be a hub discipline with a great deal to offer (and learn from) other scientific disciplines.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n<strong>References</strong><br />\r\nBoyack, K.W., Klavans, R., &amp; Börner, K.

IU is expected to receive a total of about $11 million from NSF over the next five years to create, implement and operate Jetstream, making it the largest grant IU has ever received to deliver computational and data storage services to the national research community.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nJetstream will be a user-friendly cloud environment designed to give researchers and students access to computing and data analysis resources on demand — from their tablets, laptops or desktop computers. People will interact with the system through a menu of “virtual machines” designed to support research in many disciplines including biology, atmospheric science, earth science, economics, network science, observational astronomy and social sciences. Jetstream will also allow creators of new research software to make those tools easily available to potential users, speeding their adoption.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\"Since its establishment in 2000, Indiana University’s Pervasive Technology Institute has helped solidify the university’s reputation as a global leader in information technology, while contributing to economic development through innovation and invention,” said IU President Michael A. McRobbie. “This latest major grant to PTI, which will help establish the National Science Foundation’s first cloud environment for science and engineering research, reflects the outstanding record of accomplishments by researchers in the institute and elsewhere at IU, as well as their record of highly successful collaboration with other leading research centers nationally.\"\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nBrad Wheeler, IU vice president for information technology and chief information officer, added: “Jetstream is like an ‘easy button’ giving researchers simple access to supercomputing tools and data sets. They can work from hand-held devices or even old PCs and have bundles of the most useful software tools for their research available via Jetstream. As research becomes more sophisticated with big data and computation, tools like Jetstream make it easy for faculty and students to make the best use of the tools they need from just about anywhere.”\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nAt its core, Jetstream will empower new communities of researchers who previously lacked access to high performance computing and software resources.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n“In the atmosphere, a jet stream is the border between two different masses of air,” said Craig Stewart, Jetstream principal investigator, IU Pervasive Technology Institute executive director, associate dean of IU Research Technologies and adjunct faculty member in the School of Informatics and Computing. “The new Jetstream cloud system will operate at the border between the existing NSF-funded cyberinfrastructure and thousands of new users. Jetstream will be widely used because it will apply cloud computing approaches to advance important scientific research.”\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Pervasive Technology Institute, a seasoned team of organizations and experts will implement Jetstream, including the University of Texas at Austin’s Texas Advanced Computing Center; University of Chicago; University of Arizona; and University of Texas, San Antonio. Other collaborators include Johns Hopkins University; Pennsylvania State University; Cornell University; University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff; University of Hawaii; the National Snow and Ice Data Center; the Odum Institute at the University of North Carolina; and the National Center for Genome Analysis Support.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nAt IU, several leaders from IU’s School of Informatics and Computing will also participate in the Jetstream project: Professors Beth Plale, Katy Börner and Volker Brendel, as well as IUPUI Department of Computer and Information Science professor Fengguang Song.  \r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nFor technical information about Jetstream, visit the <a href=\"http://www.pti.iu.edu/jetstream\" target=\"_blank\">Jetstream</a> website, which includes a technical backgrounder.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>About the Pervasive Technology Institute</b>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nThe <a href=\"http://pti.iu.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Pervasive Technology Institute at Indiana University</a> is a world-class organization dedicated to the development and delivery of innovative information technology to advance research, education, industry and society. Since 2000, PTI has received more than $50 million from the National Science Foundation to advance the nation’s research cyberinfrastructure. Established by a major grant from the Lilly Endowment, the Pervasive Technology Institute brings together researchers and technologists from a range of disciplines and organizations, including the IU School of Informatics and Computing, the IU Maurer School of Law and the College of Arts and Sciences at Bloomington and University Information Technology Services at Indiana University."},

BibSonomy (http://www.bibsonomy.org) is a web-based social resource sharing system hosted by the Knowledge and Data Engineering Group of University of Kassel, Germany. BibSonomy lets users retrieve, tag, and share publication references encoded in BibTex as well as Web links.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThe pie chart on the top left shows the different entity types within the BibTex entries. About 50% of the total BibTex entries are articles. Below are top-20 counts for journals, author institutions, publishers, and books.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThe figure in the center presents the distribution of BibTex article data across the different sciences. The visualization uses the ‘UCSD Basemap of Science’ created by Boyack and Klavans (2007) based on 7.2 million papers and over 16,000 separate journals, proceedings, and series from Thomson Reuters’ Web of Science and Elsevier’s Scopus database over year 2001 to 2005. Eighty percent of the BibTex articles in over 3,000 journals can be located on the UCSD Basemap of Science. Most of the papers are in the social sciences and there is a strong focus on brain research, math, physics, electrical engineering, and computer science. Node size represents the number of papers per node. On the right hand side are distributions in the data for records (meaning BibTex entries and bookmarks), tags, articles, and users.<br/><br/>\r\n \r\n<strong>PEER REVIEW COMMENT No. 1</strong><br/>\r\nThe authors offer a visualization layout which summarizes a vast amount of information about the bibliographic connections across disciplines. The figure shows, in a snapshot, how different disciplines connect to the rest of the science world: for example, the social sciences are linked to the health professionals who, in turn, are connected to some of the natural sciences. This visualization offers an attractive color and layout scheme, cleanly summarizing a large network; it does not, however, tell a clear single story, and the viewer is left a little puzzled as to the point. In that sense, it is truly more akin to a map rather than a typical analytic graphic.<br/><br/>\r\n \r\n<strong>PEER REVIEW COMMENT No. 2</strong><br/>\r\nThe authors have summarized a tremendous amount of information into a single visualization, that nicely differentiates fields of knowledge. The visualization makes good use of color but the distinction between edge strengths connecting the nodes is rather weak. The image does a nice job of quantifying the visualization with the scaled node size and distributions. The layout – based on a 2-d projection of a spherical layout, is very clever. But it is also not immediately clear to viewers. I wonder if it would be useful to include a “globe” inset or similar. This is largely a reader context issue – we’re used to seeing 2-d projections of the earth map and these are untroubling (for users, anyway), since we know the underlying 3-d distruibution. Here, the closeness of the right/left “ends” of the map may be misinterpreted as further from each other than the data show.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n<strong>PEER REVIEW COMMENT No. 3</strong><br/>\r\nThis submission leverages the Mercator projection into a very inventive solution to odd layout results. It preserves the layout's effective demonstration of the gradual way in which related disciplines blend into each other, but presents that layout in a more engaging way. I wonder if the blending remains as clear without the journal grouping – are we seeing latent structure revealed in the central tendency of journal groups, or is this a function of niche differentiation among journals that cater to a similar audience?"},

Utter destruction will come to them during the last months of the year.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nFifty-seven years later, while in his eighties, a French civil engineer who has enjoyed studying streams and physics, and drawing maps of economic phenomena, will shift his interest to historical subjects.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nCharles Joseph Minard will depict the soldiers’ travesty in a single map one that has become irrevocably linked to Bonaparte’s march, and in its own way, just as iconic.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nOverlaid on the map of Russia, a brown band represents the diminishing size of Napoleon’s forces as the army moved up and down the latitude and longitudes of the vast country. The troops had passed the frozen Niemen River at a gallop, going from Kovno to Vilna before splitting at Polotzk. By September of 1812 only 100,000 soldiers had reached Moscow. Perhaps in the works of M.M. Thiers and the unpublished diary of Jacob, a pharmacist of the Army, Minard absorbed these details, as well as what happened next: With much of Moscow incinerated (historians debate whether the Muscovites deliberately set their own city ablaze, or whether the fires where accidental), the Czar and Moscow’s citizens fled the city. A stunned and empty-handed Napoleon was forced into retreat. <br/><br/>\r\n\r\n<em>Read the full article on the web <a href=\"http://seedmagazine.com/content/article/mapping_science/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, or download a PDF of the article <a href=\"/docs/news/20110124_Seed.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</em>"},

The celebration of this award remedies that by honoring both Ans van Tienhoven and the work of the library. Ans van Tienhoven passed away unexpectedly last November, so this was first year the ceremony occurred without her presence. Standing in to preside over this year’s award celebration was the couple’s daughter, Arianne Tepper.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nFrom scanning technologies to ontologies, the award has fostered innovation, collaboration, and new technical skills among Mann staff. Kathy is interested in the field of information visualization and visual analytics.  Given Cornell’s recent focus on e-science and cyberinfrastructure, her investigation into interactive visual interfaces for retrieving information from large digital databases and datasets will benefit students, researchers, and scholars campuswide.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nKathy plans to visit Dr. Chaomei Chen, of Drexel University, a leading researcher on empirical studies of information visualization, and gather information about the latest uses and testing of those tools. She will also invite Dr. Katy Borner, the director of the information visualization laboratory at Indiana University, to give a seminar at Cornell and speak to library staff as well as others from departments such as computer science and science and technology studies.\r\n<br/><br/>"},

Inside the cell the scene is evocative of the 1966 science fiction movie &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060397/\">Fantastic Voyage</a>,&rdquo; in which Lilliputian humans in a minuscule capsule take a medical journey through a human body.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThere is an important difference &mdash; &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.calacademy.org/academy/exhibits/planetarium/life/\">Life: A Cosmic Journey</a>,&rdquo; a multimedia presentation now showing at the new Morrison Planetarium here at the California Academy of Sciences, relies not just on computer animation techniques, but on a wealth of digitized scientific data as well.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThe planetarium show is a visually spectacular demonstration of the way computer power is transforming the sciences, giving scientists tools as important to current research as the microscope and telescope were to earlier scientists. Their use accompanies a fundamental change in the material that scientists study. Individual specimens, whether fossils, living organisms or cells, were once the substrate of discovery. Now, to an ever greater extent, researchers work with immense collections of digital data, and the mastery of such mountains of information depends on computing power.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThe physical technology of scientific research is still here &mdash; the new electron microscopes, the telescopes, the particle colliders &mdash; but they are now inseparable from computing power, and it is the computers that let scientists find order and patterns in the raw information that the physical tools gather.        <br/><br/>\r\n\r\nComputer power not only aids research, it defines the nature of that research: what can be studied, what new questions can be asked, and answered. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n&ldquo;The profound thing is that today all scientific instruments have computing intelligence inside, and that&rsquo;s a huge change,&rdquo; said Larry Smarr, an astrophysicist who is director of the <a href=\"http://www.calit2.net/\">California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology</a>, or Calit2, a research consortium at the University California, San Diego. <br/><br/>\r\n\r\nIn the planetarium&rsquo;s first production, &ldquo;Fragile Planet,&rdquo; the viewer was transported through the roof of the Morrison, first appearing to fly in a graceful arc around the <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/renzo_piano/index.html?inline=nyt-per\" title=\"More articles about Renzo Piano.\" class=\"meta-per\">Renzo Piano</a>-designed museum and then quickly out into the solar system to explore the cosmos. Where visual imagery was once projected on the dome of the original Morrison Planetarium using an elaborate home-brew star projector, the new system is powered by three separate parallel computing systems which store so much data that the system is both telescope and microscope. From incomprehensibly small to unimaginably large, the computerized planetarium moves seamlessly over 12 orders of magnitude in the objects it presents. It can shift &ldquo;from subatomic to the large-scale structure of the universe,&rdquo; said Ryan Wyatt, an astronomer who is director of the planetarium. <br/><br/>\r\n\r\nIt is, said Katy B&ouml;rner, an <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/i/indiana_university/index.html?inline=nyt-org\" title=\"More articles about Indiana University\" class=\"meta-org\">Indiana University</a> computer scientist who is a specialist in scientific visualization, a &ldquo;macroscope.&rdquo; She uses the word to describe a new class of computer-based scientific instruments to which the new planetarium&rsquo;s virtual and physical machine belongs. These are composite tools, with different kinds of physical presences that have such powerful and flexible software programs that they become a complete scientific workbench that can be reconfigured by mixing and matching aspects of the software to tackle specific research problems.        <br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThe planetarium&rsquo;s macroscope is designed for education, but it could be used for research. Like any macroscope, its essence is its capacity for approaching huge databases in a variety of ways. &ldquo;Macroscopes provide a &lsquo;vision of the whole,&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; Dr. B&ouml;rner wrote in the <a href=\"http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2011/3/105316-plug-and-play-macroscopes/fulltext\">March issue of The Communications of the Association for Computing Machinery</a>, &ldquo;helping us &lsquo;synthesize&rsquo; the related elements and detect patterns, trends and outliers while granting access to myriad details.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; She said software-based scientific instruments are making it possible to uncover phenomena and processes that in the past have been, &ldquo;too great, slow or complex for the human eye and mind to notice and comprehend.&rdquo;<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nComputing is reshaping scientific research in a number of ways, Dr. B&ouml;rner notes. For example, independent scientists have increasingly given way to research teams as cited by scientific papers in the field of high-energy physics that routinely have hundreds or even thousands of authors. It is unsurprising, in a way, since the Web was invented as a collaboration tool for the high-energy physics community at <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/cern/index.html?inline=nyt-org\" title=\"More articles about CERN.\" class=\"meta-org\">CERN</a>, the European nuclear research laboratory, in the early 1990s. As a result research teams in all scientific disciplines are increasingly both interdisciplinary and widely distributed geographically.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nSo-called Web 2.0 software, with its seamless linking of applications, has made it easier to share research findings, and that in turn has led to an explosion of collaborative efforts. It has also accelerated the range of cross-disciplinary projects as it has become easier to repurpose and combine software-based techniques ranging from analytical tools to utilities for exporting and importing data.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nA macroscope need not be in a single physical location. To take one example, a midday visitor to the lab of Tom DeFanti, a computer graphics specialist, in the Calit2 building in San Diego is greeted by a wall-size array of screens that appears to offer a high-resolution window into a vacant laboratory somewhere else in the world. The distant room is a parallel laboratory at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, in Thuwal, Saudi Arabia. Four years ago representatives of that university visited Calit2 and initiated a collaboration in which the American scientists helped create a parallel scientific visualization center in Thuwal connected to the Internet by up to 10 gigabits of bandwidth &mdash; enough to share high-resolution imagery and research.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nSaudi researchers now have access to a software system known as Scalable Adaptive Graphics Environment, or SAGE, originally developed to permit scientists working far apart to share and visualize research data. SAGE is essentially an operating system for visual information, capable of displaying and manipulating images up to about one-third of a billion pixels &mdash; as much as 150 times more than what can be displayed on a conventional computer display.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n&ldquo;The killer application is collaboration; that is what people want,&rdquo; Dr. DeFanti said. &ldquo;You can save so much energy by not flying to London that it will run a rack of computers for a year.&rdquo; <br/><br/>\r\n\r\nMore than a decade ago Dr. Smarr began building a distributed supercomputing capability he called the <a title=\" \" href=\"http://www.optiputer.net/\">OptIPuter</a>, because it used the fiber-optic links among the nation&rsquo;s supercomputer centers to make it possible to divide computing problems as well as digital data so that larger scientific computing loads could be shared.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThe advent of high-performance computing systems, however, created a new bottleneck for scientists, he said. &ldquo;Over the past decade computers have become over a thousand times faster because of Moore&rsquo;s Law and the ability to store information has gone up roughly 10,000 times, while the number of pixels we can display is maybe only a factor of two different,&rdquo; he said.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nTo make it possible for visualization to catch up with accelerating computing capacity, researchers at Calit2 and others have begun designing display systems called <a href=\"http://wiki.optiputer.net/optiportal/index.php/Main_Page\">OptIPortals</a> that offer better ways of representing scientific data.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nRecently, the Calit2 researchers have begun building scaled-down versions called OptIPortables, which are smaller display systems that can be fashioned like Lego blocks from just a handful of displays, rather than dozens or hundreds. The OptIPortable displays can be quickly set up and moved, and Dr. DeFanti said his lab was now at capacity assembling systems for research groups around the world. <br/><br/>\r\n\r\nWithin many scientific fields software-based instruments are quickly adding new functions as open-source systems make it possible for small groups or even individuals to add features that permit customization. <br/><br/>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.cytoscape.org/\">Cytoscape</a> is a bioinformatics software tool set that evolved, beginning in 2001, from research in the laboratory of Leroy Hood at the <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/u/university_of_washington/index.html?inline=nyt-org\" title=\"More articles about University of Washington\" class=\"meta-org\">University of Washington</a>. Dr. Hood, one of the founders of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Systems_Biology\">Institute for Systems Biology</a> in Seattle, was a pioneer in the field of automated gene sequencing, and one of his graduate students at the time, Trey Ideker, was exploring whether it was possible to automate the mapping of gene interactions.        <br/><br/>\r\n\r\nAs complex a task as gene sequencing is, charting the multiplicity of interactions that are possible among the roughly 30,000 genes that make up the human chromosome is even more complex. It has led to the emergence of the field of network biology as biologists begin to build computer-aided models of cellular and disease processes.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Very quickly we realized we weren&rsquo;t the only ones facing this problem and that others were independently developing software tools,&rdquo; Dr. Ideker said. The researchers decided to take what at the time was a large risk, and began to develop their code as an open-source software development project, meaning that it could be freely shared by the entire biological community. The project picked up speed when Dr. Ideker, who is now <a href=\"http://idekerlab.ucsd.edu/Pages/default.aspx\">chief of genetics at the U.C.S.D. School of Medicine</a>, merged his efforts with Gary Bader, a biologist who now runs a computational biology laboratory at the University of Toronto.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThe project picked up collaborators in the past decade as other researchers decided to contribute to it rather than develop independent tools. The project picked up even more speed because the software was designed so that new modules could be contributed by independent researchers who wanted to tailor it for specific tasks.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n&ldquo;We allowed what we called plug-ins back in 2001 &mdash; nowadays with <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/apple_computer_inc/index.html?inline=nyt-org\" title=\"More information about Apple Incorporated\" class=\"meta-org\">Apple</a>&rsquo;s success you would call them an app,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There are a couple of hundred apps available for Cytoscape.&rdquo; The project is now maintained with a $6.5 million grant from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences at the <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/n/national_institutes_of_health/index.html?inline=nyt-org\" title=\"More articles about National Institutes of Health, U.S.\" class=\"meta-org\">National Institutes of Health</a>.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nTools like Cytoscape have a symbiotic relationship with immense databases that have grown to support the activities of scientists who are studying newer fields like genomics and proteomics. Gene sequencing led to the creation of Genbank, which is now maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information. And with a growing array of digital data streams, other databases are being curated &mdash; in Europe, for example, at the European Bioinformatics Institute, which has begun to build an array of new databases for functions like protein interactions. Cytoscape helps transform the disparate databases into a federated whole with the aid of plug-ins that allow a scientist to pick and chose from different sources.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nFor Dr. B&ouml;rner, the Indiana University computer scientist, the Cytoscape model is a powerful one that builds on the sharing mechanism that is the foundation of the Internet.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThe idea, she said, is inspired by witnessing the power and impact of the sharing inherent in Web services like Flickr and YouTube. Moreover, it has the potential of being rapidly replicated across many scientific disciplines.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n&ldquo;You can now also share plug-in algorithms,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You can now create your own library by plugging in your favorite algorithms into your tool.&rdquo;"},

In addition to leading one-day courses and securing a recent presidential appointment to an advisory panel relating to accountability in the economic recovery package, Tufte is, according to his Web site, opening a gallery, ET Modern, in New York City's Chelsea neighborhood.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nTufte's many disciples will no doubt be pleased to learn of Places & Spaces: Mapping Science, a multiyear project devoted to data visualization in the scientific sphere. An exhibit of science maps from the project are now on view through May 31 at the Marston Science Library at the University of Florida. But if you cannot make it to Gainesville in time, fret not: the maps are viewable online. And next year, wherever the exhibit goes, there will be even more on display.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n\"Every year we add 10 new maps,\" explains co-curator Katy Börner, a professor of information science at Indiana University Bloomington. Each year has a different theme, Börner notes—this year's theme is \"science maps for scholars\". In 2014, at the end of the 10-year project, the exhibition will contain 100 maps representing a diverse range of uses for scientific information—some maps are intended for policymakers, some for librarians, some for children. And although many are \"maps\" in the strictest cartographic sense of the world—visual plots of geographic information—others are more abstract, charting scientific data or trends. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThe unifying goal is that the maps present a viewpoint that is both compelling and informative. \"These maps are not designed to be eye candy; they are designed to convey information,\" Börner says. \"The point is to engage the viewer's eyes and minds.\"\r\n"},

Analysis, navigation, and management of these continuously evolving data sets require a new kind of data-analysis and visualization tool we call a macroscope (from the Greek macros, or \"great,\" and skopein, or \"to observe\") inspired by de Rosnay's futurist science writings.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nJust as the microscope made it possible for the naked human eye to see cells, microbes, and viruses, thereby advancing biology and medicine, and just as the telescope opened the human mind to the immensity of the cosmos and the conquest of space—the macroscope promises to help make sense of yet another dimension—the infinitely complex. Macroscopes provide a \"vision of the whole,\" helping us \"synthesize\" the related elements and detect patterns, trends, and outliers while granting access to myriad details.18,19 Rather than make things larger or smaller, macroscopes let us observe what is at once too great, slow, or complex for the human eye and mind to notice and comprehend.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nMany of the best micro-, tele-, and macroscopes are designed by scientists keen to observe and comprehend what no one has seen or understood before. Galileo Galilei (1564–1642) recognized the potential of a spyglass for the study of the heavens, ground and polished his own lenses, and used the improved optical instruments to make discoveries like the moons of Jupiter, providing quantitative evidence for the Copernican theory. Today, scientists repurpose, extend, and invent new hardware and software to create macroscopes that may solve both local and global challenges20 (see the sidebar \"Changing Scientific Landscape\").\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nMy aim here is to inspire computer scientists to implement software frameworks that empower domain scientists to assemble their own continuously evolving macroscopes, adding and upgrading existing (and removing obsolete) plug-ins to arrive at a set that is truly relevant for their work—with little or no help from computer scientists. Some macroscopes may resemble cyberinfrastructures (CIs),1 providing user-friendly access to massive amounts of data, services, computing resources, and expert communities. Others may be Web services or standalone tools. While microscopes and telescopes are physical instruments, macroscopes resemble continuously changing bundles of software plug-ins. Macroscopes make it easy to select and combine algorithm and tool plug-ins but also interface plug-ins, workflow support, logging, scheduling, and other plug-ins needed for scientifically rigorous work. They make it easy to share plug-ins via email, flash drives, or online. To use new plug-ins, simply copy the files into the plug-in directory, and they appear in the tool menu ready for use. No restart of the tool is necessary. Sharing algorithm components, tools, and novel interfaces becomes as easy as sharing images on Flickr or videos on YouTube. Assembling custom tools is as quick as compiling your custom music collection.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThe macroscopes presented here were built using the Open Services Gateway Initiative Framework (OSGi) industry standard and the Cyberinfrastructure Shell (CIShell) that supports integration of new and existing algorithms into simple yet powerful tools. As of January 2011, six different research communities were benefitting from OSGi and/or CIShell powered tools. Several other tool-development efforts consider adoption.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n<em>Read the full article on the web <a href=\"http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2011/3/105316-plug-and-play-macroscopes/fulltext#\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, or download a PDF of the article <a href=\"/docs/news/20110301_CommACM.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</em>"},

Each map has to fit the theme of the respective iteration. Submissions are evaluated in terms of two kinds of values: i) Scientific value, which centers on quality of data collection, analysis and communication of results in support of clearly stated objectives, and whether the map represents appropriate and innovative application of existing algorithms and/or development of new approaches; ii) Value for user groups (e.g., kids), which considers the following questions: what major insight does the map provide and why does it matter? Is the map easy to understand? Does it inspire kids to learn more about science and technology?\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n<strong>Could you say a few words about the new iteration?</strong><br/>\r\n\r\nThe 8th iteration of the Mapping Science exhibit is devoted to science maps that kids aged 5–14 can use to gain a more holistic understanding and appreciation of science and technology. Each map should be engaging and fun to peruse yet should have at least one concrete learning objective. Among others, the maps might depict:\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nA concept map telling a science story;<br/>\r\nFamous adventures, encounters, or discoveries in science history;<br/>\r\nZooms in-out of the world of science;<br/>\r\nSurprising, scary, wonderful, and exciting scientific activities;<br/>\r\nTimelines of science and technology development and inventions;<br/>\r\nExhibit holdings at different science museums (location, subject matter, or both);<br/>\r\nA map of school science curricula, projects, or science textbook contents;<br/>\r\nCareer trajectories in science;<br/>\r\nScience maps drawn by kids analogous to Children Map the World<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nMaps are intended to give children the exciting opportunity to immerse in, explore, or navigate the landscape of science and to find their own place.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n<strong>Places & Spaces: Mapping Science is a travelling exhibition. Can any interested party purchase their own maps and display them?</strong><br/>\r\n\r\nMaps are on display at public libraries, science museums, national academies of science, universities, companies and are seen, discussed, admired, and purchased by scholars, practitioners, educators, and others. Maps are available for sale at http://scimaps.org/store and proceeds help finance the creation of new iterations and their display at public venues.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n<strong>How do you think ‘Big Data’ computation will influence the production and usefulness of scientific maps?</strong><br/>\r\n\r\nThe bigger and more complex the datasets, the higher the need for effective data mining and visualization to guide data management, navigation, and utilization. Originally, publication, funding, and patent data were dominantly used in science of science studies. Today, researchers also study science news, job market, and even S&T twitter data—in real time. The monitoring, mining, modeling, and visualization of all relevant data streams in many different languages and the wide-spread distribution of results will require major computational infrastructures.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n<strong>Is the visualization technology there to deal with big-data issues such as size and complexity?</strong><br/>\r\n\r\nThe total number of scholars, papers, books, patents, and grants in existence today is rather small when compared with datasets generated and mined in medicine, physics, or meteorology. Tools like the Network Workbench (NWB) or Science of Science (Sci2) tool can extract, analyze, and layout networks with a million nodes. The NIH Map Viewer lets you interactively browse multiple years of funding by the National Institutes of Health. The mapping sustainability project maps seven different paper, patent, and funding datasets in geospatial and topic space (http://mapsustain.cns.iu.edu).\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n<strong>Do you feel that the explosion in software solutions for network data management and visualization (including Network Workbench) has made life easier or harder for network scientists and in what way?</strong><br/>\r\n\r\nThe Network Workbench was designed for researchers, educators, and practitioners interested in the study of biomedical, social and behavioral science, physics, and other networks and has been downloaded by 110,000 users around the globe. The Science of Science (Sci2) Tool was developed for science policy makers and researchers that study science by scientific means. It supports temporal, geospatial, topical, and network analysis and visualization of scholarly datasets at the micro (individual), meso (local), and macro (global) levels, and is used by many scholars, practitioners, and major agencies such as the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the US Department of Agriculture, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. While the agencies cannot share their data holdings, they can apply the very same analysis workflow to their internal data and compare results across agency boundaries. Plus, program officers and analysts can use Sci2 to download and analyze relevant data from, for example, Elsevier’s Scopus or Thomson Reuter’s Web of Science databases. Instead of getting a report from a contractor they now have an easy-to-use tool to answer their very own questions."},

It becomes absolutely critical in challenging financial times such as the present. Proving your value is equally as important for scientific institutions and research organizations as it is to businesses. Rising costs of scientific research and shrinking research budgets means increased competition for a limited number of research grants. To compete effectively for funding, scientific institutions of all sizes need to be able to clearly and succinctly demonstrate the value of their research.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nExternal peer review is the traditional measure for evaluating scientific research. Due to the substantial costs and limited scope of peer review, research institutions are increasingly turning to bibliometrics to supplement this process. Bibliometrics is the scientific analysis of publications that seeks to identify the major fields of study within and across scientific disciplines and the most influential publications, research institutions, and researchers in each of these fields. Despite some significant limitations of this approach, bibliometric analysis can supplement the peer-review process to demonstrate the value of scientific research.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nBibliometric mapping is particularly well-suited to doing this. By extracting relationships among publications, bibliometric mapping offers a method of quickly summarizing and then visualizing the structure inherent to a set of publications. The resulting visualizations, or maps, can be used not only to examine an institution’s past scientific research but also to identify potential future research directions and collaboration opportunities.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n<strong>Network Science</strong><br/><br/>\r\n\r\nBibliometric mapping is one of the many applications of network science. To better understand bibliometric maps, it is useful to have a general understanding of network science. Network science is the study of how things relate to one another—the study of the relationships among members of a group. By studying the nature of these relationships and the overall structure of these networks, network science attempts to deduce the role of individual members and learn something about the nature of the network as a whole.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nAt its most basic level, a network consists of two variables—nodes and edges. Nodes represent the individual members of a group, and edges represent the presence of a relationship between two nodes. In a friendship network, for example, nodes represent people and edges represent the presence of a friendship between those two people. Consider the web: Nodes represent websites and edges represent the presence of hyperlinks from one website to another. Other networks can be as varied as actors co-starring in movies, electrical stations connected by power lines, and protein reactions within cells.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nIn more complex and representative networks, both nodes and edges can have specific characteristics associated with them. Depending on the network, both nodes and edges can have numerical values, belong to certain categories, or be of different types. Edges can also be either directed or undirected. Directed edges show the movement of something—electrical current or a web surfer, for example—from one node to another. Undirected edges simply indicate the presence of a relationship between nodes.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n<strong>CREATING NETWORK MAPS</strong>\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nA visual representation, or map, of the entire network can be created once the network is constructed. In laying out the map, each node is positioned between other nodes to which it is connected by edges. This means that the absolute position of a node on the map is not meaningful, but its relative position is. Nodes that are more closely related are placed near each other, while nodes that are less related are placed farther away. In most modern visualizations, nodes are represented by shapes, such as circles, and edges are represented either as lines connecting the nodes or, in a network with directed edges, as arrows pointing from one node to another. Both nodes and edges can be sized and color-coded to represent different characteristics of the network.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nIn working with these maps, it is important to pay attention to the way that nodes form groups. Nodes in these groups, called clusters, are highly interconnected within the cluster but relatively weakly connected to the rest of the network. These clusters represent semi-autonomous communities, or subsets, of the larger network. It is also important to look past what shows on the map. The blank spaces on the map between nodes and clusters indicate the relationships or connections that have not yet been made. As with older geographical maps, think “Here be dragons”; blank spaces on the map indicate areas of potential opportunity waiting to be discovered.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n<strong>Publication Networks</strong>\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nA bibliometric map, then, is the visualization of a network created from a set of scientific publications. Three basic types of networks can be created from these sets—collaboration networks, semantic networks, and publication citation networks. Within each of these three types, it is possible to create a number of additional networks depending on the specifics of how the networks are constructed.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nCollaboration networks show the collaboration of authors, institutions, or countries in the production of scientific research. The most basic type of collaboration network is the co-author network, in which nodes represent authors and edges represent publications on which authors have collaborated. By extracting author affiliations and addresses from co-author networks, we can create institutional and country collaboration networks. Issues with name disambiguation and authority control plague all of these networks.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nSemantic networks analyze the occurrence of certain words in a set of publications. The most common form of semantic networks is a word co-occurrence network. In this network, nodes represent words and edges represent the co-occurrence of those words in the same publication. Words used in these networks can be drawn from the full text of the publications in the set or, more usually, from the title, keywords, and/or abstracts of those publications. Words used in these networks are typically cleaned through truncation, and the removal of stop words before the network is generated, but these networks still suffer from issues with synonymy and homonymy.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nPublication citation networks show the relationships among scientific publications based on their citations. There are three kinds of publication citation networks: direct citation, bibliographic coupling, and co-citation. Nodes represent scientific publications in all three of these kinds of networks; the difference is how the edges are created.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nIn a direct citation network, edges represent a direct citation from publication A to publication B. Direct citation networks are the simplest kind of publication citation network, but they are the least effective of the three in representing the actual structure of scientific research. In a bibliographic coupling network, an edge is drawn between two nodes if the publications represented by the nodes both cite the same previous publication(s). On the other hand, a co-citation network draws an edge between two publications if they are both cited by the same subsequent publication(s).\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n<strong>Using Bibliometric Maps</strong>\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThese three types of networks have different uses. Collaboration networks are particularly well-suited to identifying who created the publications in the set. A bibliometric map created from a collaboration network—in which nodes are sized based on publication or citation count and edges are sized based on the number of collaborations between nodes—allows the user to see the central authors or institutions represented in the network. Clusters of nodes in the map show both the research communities that coalesce around particular topics and the relationships among those communities. The map also shows the relationships or collaborations that have not been made: The lack of edges between adjacent nodes or clusters may represent opportunities for future collaboration.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, publication citation and semantic networks are better at identifying what the publications in the set are about. A map of a semantic network, such as a word co-occurrence network, shows not only the most common words used in a publication set but also the relative centrality of those words. Words mapped at the center of the network tend to be those that are common to all of the publications in the set, while words near the edges of the map tend to be those used by a smaller subset of publications. Words at the edges of the map tend to form clusters of related words that, when taken together, describe the major research directions represented in the publication set.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nBibliometric maps created from publication citation networks are the most effective method of describing and evaluating a set of scientific publications. Nodes in these networks can be sized based on the number of citations each publication has received, and edges can be sized based on the strength of their citation similarity.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nLike all real-world networks, publication citation networks form clusters. Since bibliographic coupling and co-citation networks are based on shared citations, and since publications that cite the same publications are likely to be about the same things, clusters formed in these networks represent research topics, while groups of clusters represent fields of study. A bibliometric map, then, shows both the number of publications and the impact of those publications, as measured by citation counts, in each research topic and field of study shown on the map.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n<strong>OPPORTUNITIES FOR FUTURE RESEARCH</strong>\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nIn addition to showing what research has already been done, bibliometric maps indicate opportunities for future research. Because they show the existing relationships among publications within a research topic, bibliometric maps also show, through blank spaces on the map, which connections within the topic have not yet been made.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nSimilarly, because bibliometric maps show the existing relationships between clusters and groups of clusters, blank spaces between clusters can point to the intertopical and interdisciplinary connections that have not yet been made. These connections could be single publications or even entire new research directions positioned in between those already shown on the map.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nFindings from these different kinds of networks can be used in many ways. Collaboration networks can identify the most productive and highly cited authors, institutions, and countries in the publication set. Semantic networks can identify the concepts central to all publications in the set as well as those central to the various research directions represented in the set. Publication citation networks can identify the quantity and citation impact of publications in each of these research directions and disciplines.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nPerforming these analyses on a set of publications for a particular research topic provides a great deal of information about the structure and direction of research being done on that topic. Performing these analyses on publications produced by a research institution not only assists the institution in defining its past successes and future opportunities but also, when combined with targeted peer review, helps the institution demonstrate the value of its publication output and, by extension, the research that it conducts."},

It was on the required reading list for my information science masters course, and – I suspect like many other students of the subject at that time – I wondered what it was doing there. It took some while before I realised that Price’s work, which founded the subject known generally known as scientometrics, was intimately connected with the information sciences, building on the laws of “statistical bibliography” developed earlier by Bradford, Zipf, Pareto and the rest.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nIt now is taken for granted that bibliometrics and scientometrics are an integral part of information science, albeit that they overlap into other disciplines. Just how far they have come since Price’s day, with particular encouragement from the development of information visualisation techniques in the last decade, is shown in a remarkable new book (Börner, 2010).\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThat an atlas of science of this sort, which rightly claims to set out the evolution of scientific knowledge, disciplines and applications, should be complied by a professor of information science, as Katy Börner is, shows the extent to which Price’s ideas have been adopted by our discipline. A beautifully produced, and very large, book, it accompanies a physical exhibition of science maps, running until 2014 and continually augmented with new material. The core of the book is a series of 31 examples of mappings of science and scientific progress: from Napoleon’s march on Moscow to the period table, and from Wikipedia’s coverage of scientific issues to visualisations of DNA development and patent applications. Fascinating in themselves, they put this book, to my mind, on a par with the books by Tufte (1997) and Barrow (2008), as exemplifications of good use of images in conveying complex information and ideas.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThe book is much more than this, however: indeed, this is only one of five parts. Of particular interest to anyone reflecting on the relations between the mapping of science and information disciplines is the second part, covering the history of science maps, and the third, covering the development of the “science of science”. Here we find sections on familiar topics: the collection, organisation and dissemination of knowledge; classification, interlinking and visualisation, co-citation and invisible colleges; and the idea of a “global brain”, able to comprehend it all. And some familiar names: Gutenberg, Nelson, Berners-Lee, Dewey, Otlet, Shepard, Garfield, Bush, Licklider, Zipf, Bradford, Lotka and Pareto. These sections, with their appealing timelines and linkages of influence, would serve a novel and attention-catching introduction to the main ideas and personalities across a substantial part of the information sciences.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nBörner’s magnum opus shows not only how far we have come in scientometrics, but also how closely related the subject is with the rest of information science. In a review in Scientometrics, Leydesdorff (2011) says this is a wonderful book, and I agree. I think de Solla Price would too.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nDavid Bawden\r\n<br/><br/><br/>\r\n\r\n<strong>References</strong><br/>\r\n\r\nBarrow, J.D.

Examples\r\ninclude traffic patterns, disease outbreaks and social media.\r\nOften, the most effective way of coming to terms with this data is by\r\npicturing or visualizing it. Throughout history, many of the best tools\r\nfor visualization have been designed by scientists keen to observe or\r\ncomprehend something for the first time. In the early 1600s, Galileo\r\nGalilei recognized the potential of a spyglass to study the heavens,\r\nand ground and polished his own lenses. He then used these improved\r\noptical instruments to make discoveries like the moons of Jupiter,\r\nproviding quantitative evidence for Copernicus’s startling insight that\r\nthe earth revolves around the sun and not the other way around.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nToday, scientists and industry professionals repurpose, extend and\r\ninvent new hardware and software to visually make sense of and address\r\nlocal and global challenges. For example, they might combine\r\ndata on global population density, patient records and social behavior\r\n– all large, complex data sets – to model, visualize and forecast\r\nthe spread of epidemic diseases. Or they might (and did) map how\r\nNew York City tweeted during Hurricane Sandy. Multivariate visualization\r\nis not new. In 1786, William Playfair published the first known\r\ntime series by charting English exports and imports over 80 years. In\r\n1861, Charles Joseph Minard famously plotted date, temperature,\r\ndirection of movement and three other variables in a poignant “narrative”\r\ngraphic of Napoleon’s failed Russian campaign. What is different\r\nnow is the sheer volume of data to be sifted through.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n<strong>Plug-and-play visualization tools</strong><br/><br/>\r\nVisualizing Big Data is inherently collaborative. But good data sets\r\nare hard to obtain, and standard tools are lacking. Consequently, at\r\nthe Cyberinfrastructure for Network Science Center at Indiana University,\r\nwe have created an open-source, community-driven project\r\nfor exchanging and using data sets, algorithms, tools and computing\r\nresources. In particular, we have developed software tool sets (<a href=\"http://cishell.org\" target=\"_blank\">called\r\n“macroscopes\"</a>) that enable non-computer scientists\r\nto plug and play data sets and algorithms as easily as they share\r\nimages and videos using Flickr and YouTube. Our tools have been\r\ndownloaded by more than 100,000 users from over 100 countries.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nOther open-source software projects, such as Google Code and\r\nSourceForge.net, do exist. Websites like IBM’s Many Eyes enable\r\ncommunity data sharing and visualization. Commercial programs\r\nlike Tableau and TIBCO Spotfire, and free tools, are widely used in\r\nresearch, education and industry for data analysis and visualization.\r\nBut none of these approaches enables easy mixing and matching of\r\nsoftware to solve specific research and practical problems.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nMany real-world systems must be studied and understood at multiple\r\n– i.e. local to global – levels before informed interventions can\r\nbe designed and executed. Advanced visualizations make it possible\r\nto explore and communicate the results of these diverse analyses to\r\nexperts, as well as to a general audience.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n<strong>Measuring inventiveness</strong> <br/><br/>\r\nIn former times, access to land and minerals was important for ensuring\r\nprosperity. Today, access to intellectual property is key for many\r\nindustries. Strategies for owning more and more intellectual space\r\nvary. We created a patent classification map to visually communicate\r\nthe intellectual coverage and evolution of the patent space of different\r\npatent holders (see pages 40 and 41). We obtained data on 2.5 million\r\npatents granted between 1 January 1976 and 31 December 2002\r\nfrom the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) archive. We\r\ngrouped the patents by their USPTO classification, and depicted and\r\ncontrasted classes that experienced slow or rapid growth using tree\r\nmaps, a space-filling technique developed at the Human-Computer\r\nInteraction Lab at the University of Maryland.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nFor example, we compared the evolving patent holdings of Apple\r\n(then Apple Computer) from 1980 to 2002 with those of a private\r\npatent holder, Jerome Lemelson, whose innovations led to industrial\r\nrobots, bar code readers and automatic teller machines (1976–\r\n2002). Bright green patches represent more patents for that class\r\nover the previous year, and red a decline. Black denotes no change.\r\nYellow signals “new” classes in which no patent has been granted\r\nin the previous five years. In 1976 (far left) Lemelson was granted\r\neight patents in six patent classes. The next year (1977) he has\r\nsome new patents in existing classes, but most are related to four\r\nnew classes. Whereas Apple adds new patents to existing classes,\r\nLemelson follows a different strategy to claim more and more intellectual\r\nspace. This longitudinal comparison helps to reveal an assignee’s\r\npast, current (and possibly future) intellectual limits and\r\npatenting behavior.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n<strong>Mapping the future</strong><br/><br/>\r\nData literacy will soon be as important as being able to read and write.\r\nIn January 2013, registration opened for the <a href=\"http://ivmooc.cns.iu.edu\" target=\"_blank\">Information Visualization\r\nMOOC</a> (massive open online course) that I am teaching at Indiana\r\nUniversity. Students from 93 different countries\r\nare taking theory and hands-on lessons. The course introduces\r\na theoretical framework that helps non-experts to assemble advanced\r\nanalysis workflows and to design different visualization layers, i.e.\r\nbase map, overlay (real-time) data, and color and size coding. The\r\nframework can also be applied to “dissect” visualizations so they can\r\nbe interpreted and optimized. As part of the course assignments,\r\nstudents work in teams on real-world client projects.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nDeveloping the visualization tools to handle Big Data images,\r\nvideos and data sets for scholarly markets remains a work in progress.\r\nOur current efforts focus on ways of ensuring data quality, dealing\r\nwith streaming data such as from social media, and making our tools\r\nmore modular and even easier to use. The ultimate goal of Big Data\r\nvisualizations is to understand and use our collective knowledge of\r\nscience and technology to enable anyone to explore complex technical,\r\nsocial and economic issues and to make better decisions."},

This one maps co-authored papers. The line color denotes the first year that the connected researchers co-authored papers. The node color shows the number of times that author has been cited, and the node size indicates the number of papers that researcher has authored.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nIt’s tough to find a good match, but that doesn’t stop some from logging onto social networking sites in search of one. We all want to find that special someone who complements our strengths and shares our interests.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThat’s why Michael Conlon hopes scientists around the world will someday log into VIVO: to find that special someone – or someones – with whom they can collaborate. Meet VIVO, a distributed social network for scientists that will leverage the semantic web to bring an entirely new approach to an old problem – finding the right partner for your research.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nSkeptical? The National Institute of Health, via the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, has about $12.2 million worth of confidence in the project, awarded to the seven participating research institutions in a two year grant.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nAlthough the seven funded institutions, led by the University of Florida – Conlon’s home institution – are all American, the development of VIVO has been inclusive.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n“I think two thirds of our technical advisory board is international,” Conlon said. “It’s pretty well known what we’re doing – science is an international activity.”\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n<strong>A social network, or a framework?</strong>\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nAlthough a great deal of the press VIVO has received describes the project as a social network, that descriptor is somewhat misleading. The truly innovative part of VIVO is in the underlying architecture; the applications that combine that architecture with social networking technology are just the logical progression.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n“The VIVO approach is fundamentally new,” said Conlon, the principal investigator for VIVO. “VIVO is distributed. The data are stored in institutional databases that are separate from the application. That means that the faculty don’t have to put their data in a variety of different systems.”\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nUser profiles, stored at academic research institutions, will contain “see also” pointers to other VIVO servers containing information about the pertinent user. A trusted application or website could follow the trail of pointers from VIVO server to VIVO server, grabbing data along the way, and use the data to assemble a seamless profile on the fly. One interesting side effect is that the institutions that run VIVO servers are essentially providing their researchers with credentials that can be used in transactions, or to authenticate their identity.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n<strong>You call it ontology, I call it semantics</strong>\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThe sort of information your research institution stores is certainly useful for populating a website profile. If scientists are going to use these profiles to find their perfect match, however, they’ll need a little something else – a list of their interests. But hold on. We’ve all seen what a mess it can be when websites let people use whatever interests they like. Some of the keywords people come up with are downright confusing, and the plentiful supply of synonyms available for use in the English language make it nigh-impossible to find that ideal search term that will yield no false positives or negatives.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nTo keep that from happening, “they’re going to express their interests using controlled vocabularies. If the keywords are in a controllable vocabulary, now we have meaning,” Conlon said.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nA vocabulary will have to be extremely fine-grained to be useful to scientists searching for people with whom to collaborate. After all, it’s already trivial to find another computer scientist. Finding someone who is also working on computationally intensive applications for geologists is quite a bit more difficult.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThat’s why VIVO will involve working with information science and ontology experts to create the controlled vocabulary Conlon mentioned. That may seem intimidating – or time consuming – to a lot of scientists. But Conlon has an answer for that too. “We’re trying to create a facilitation model where academics are assisted by research librarians,” Conlon said.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nDoing a good job at listing research interests could have a number of benefits beyond the obvious ‘matchmaking’ motive. For example, research institutions could route information by interest instead of relying on large email lists. VIVO users could turn the ‘volume’ up or down.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n“If you turn up the volume, you’ll get some things that are tangentially interesting to you,” Conlon explained. If you turn it down, you’ll get fewer emails, but you might miss something you consider relevant.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nSince VIVO stores profile information drawn from a variety of sources in a single, flexible format, it can be easily \"re-skinned\" or \"re-purposed\" to present specialized views into the institution, as in this screenshot of Cornell University's Graduate Programs in the Life Sciences website. Image courtesy of VIVO.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n<strong>Okay, so there <em>is</em> a social network involved</strong>\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nReporters who likened VIVO to Facebook may be gratified to hear that those websites and applications could be social networks.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nBut, “not every application is going to be created by the VIVO team,” Conlon said. “VIVO is attempting to create a framework that will be used by a number of projects.”\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nKaty Börner is the principal investigator and leader of the Indiana University team charged with creating VIVO’s official social network.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nSince the VIVO framework can track research interests, research groups, collaborations, and more, there’s a lot of potential for automatically populating social network profiles. The hope is that if researchers can use their existing credentials to log into the network, the network will develop into a popular destination for scientists wishing to seek out colleagues with similar or complementary interests. That perfect match that will encourage truly inspired interdisciplinary inquiry into the mysteries of the universe.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nIn addition to creating a social networking site that is intended to become a hotbed of scientific collaboration, the Indiana University team will also provide a monitor of VIVO activity that will hopefully include real-time visualization.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nBörner, as it happens, has an ulterior motive for working on VIVO. She is one of many scientists who hope to use VIVO to gain an understanding of how science and social networks shape each other.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n“I think we can create better tools to understand how social networks exist in science,” Börner said. “In order to do this in a systematic way you need good data.” Unfortunately, most of that data is in proprietary databases, making it difficult or impossible to replicate the few studies that have been done. VIVO could change that.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n“It’s a very powerful and very precise method for building information about science,” Conlon said.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n<strong>Speaking of networking…</strong>\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThe VIVO team has been busy networking with other projects and groups in the hopes of forming partnerships. Connecting with existing science portals such as HUBzero, or with existing cyberinfrastructures such as Open Science Grid and TeraGrid are real possibilities, according to Conlon.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n“We are involved with InCommon,” Conlon said. “We do expect a federated identity and federated access is part of the proposal.”\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThe trick will be to find a security protocol that is functional but works for most participating institutions.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThe question, according to Conlon, is: “What does it take to have a well-managed identity management system so that credentials produced at a university have some standing with others?” One solution may be what the federal government calls ‘levels of assurance.’ “InCommon has levels of assurance that match up with several definitions of level of assurance,” Conlon said.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nOne group they are collaborating with is the Center for Dental Informatics at the University of Pittsburgh, which competed with VIVO for the NIH grant. The CDI's Digital Vita system has received funding via the university’s Clinical and Translational Science Institute, which received a five-year NIH grant of $83.5 million beginning in 2007.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n“This is a stand-alone project,” said Titus Schleyer, the principal investigator for Digital Vita. Nonetheless, “we are working on getting our application to be compatible with the whole VIVO project.”\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nDigital Vita is a social network based on the idea that we must all maintain our curriculum vitae. Users enter their CV-relevant information into the system, and Digital Vita builds a network from the collaborative relationships on papers, grants, presentations, and abstracts.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n“VIVO is starting with sources of data available about individuals, both within and outside institutions. Digital Vita also uses PubMed and grants databases, but in essence is built on everything that's in a person's curriculum vitae,” Schleyer explained. “Both systems have slightly different functions and different amounts of data in them… They’re simply two ways of looking at data.”\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nGetting the two data sets to match up is no easy task. “Currently the key issue is to make our data set align with the ontology that is inside of VIVO,” Schleyer said. “It’s about aligning how data is represented in the system, so that when we publish our data, it is with the exact same meaning and format as VIVO does.”\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nAlthough Schleyer’s background is in dental informatics, it’s clear that he’s very excited about the potential of projects like Digital Vita and VIVO.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n“There is a lot of efficiency that can be generated from being smarter about information sharing, collaboration, and knowledge management. We are very much at the beginning of constructing useful systems for scientists to interact with each other. We’re kind of on the verge of creating a new class of computing applications,” Schleyer said. “Part of my interest in this project is contributing to that whole revolution – if there’s going to be one.”\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThe focus of Börner’s excitement is a little more practical. “I can’t wait to get it because I can press a button and get my CV out,” she said, adding, “I think it will also be very interesting to see who else is doing relevant work at IU and how I am connected as an investigator to them.”\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n—Miriam Boon, iSGTW"},

Wang, who developed the ChucK audio programming language, spoke about the\r\n      importance of design making a user “feel” something through its use.</p><br>\r\n    <p>“Design matters,” Wang said. “Aesthetics matter. It’s not just form or function that gives a design meaning. It should make you feel something inside.”</p><br>\r\n    <p>Wang used the ChucK programming language to create the Ocarina app, mobile software that allows people to blow into their smartphone and synthesize the sound of an ocarina. Through the app, users can make their musical pieces available around the\r\n      world to other users of the app while showing the general area of the piece’s origin. It creates a bond between users that is both lonely in a sense but also creates a sense of community.</p><br>\r\n    <p>Wang also showcased how technology is creating innovative ways to create and share music, whether it is using a laptop as an accordion—users open and close the laptop, which uses the device’s camera to judge distance and, in turn, create sounds—or\r\n      through a social karaoke app that can allow users from around the world to sing together and strengthen the sense of community.</p><br>\r\n    <p>“The humanist engineer doesn’t just design out of need,” Wang said. “There’s also a consideration of values and intentionally imbuing the things we need with some of our values. The humanist engineer should try to blend the means and the ends to get\r\n      at the heart of the synthesis of both.”</p><br>\r\n    <p>Wang’s presentation was followed by an Innovation Roundtable in the Shoemaker Innovation Center featuring Fred Luddy, the founder of ServiceNow and a critical supporter of Luddy Hall, Jane Martin, the general partner of Village Ventures, and John\r\n      Shoemaker, the chairman of the board of directors of Extreme Networks, Inc. The informal discussion featured a Q&amp;A session offering advice to the filled room of students, providing the opportunity for Luddy, Martin, and Shoemaker to use their\r\n      own experiences to inspire.</p><br>\r\n    <p>They also said that as entrepreneurs and investors, passion and a belief in an idea or product is far more important than the potential of any financial reward.</p><br>\r\n    <p>“I’m no different than your average kindergartner,” Luddy said. “I want to see my art on your refrigerator. That’s why I do what I do—to spread the idea and innovation.”</p><br>\r\n    <p>The <a href=\"https://www.engineering.indiana.edu/\">Intelligence System Engineering</a> program also stepped into the spotlight with a showcase in the fourth-floor fabrication lab. Projects were presented by various ISE classes, and they included increasing\r\n      the efficiency of data transfer to reduce the load on a “smart” network, programming a robotic vehicle called the “CrimsonBot,” improving operational data for firefighters and public safety workers in the case of wildfires through the use of drones\r\n      and remotely controlled vehicles, developing a brain-computer interface that allows users to control a robot using just their minds, engineering cyber-physical systems for a light monitoring system in the Hoosier National Forest, and more.</p><br>\r\n    <p>The Cheng Wu Innovation Challenge took over Dorsey Learning Hall in mid-afternoon as students participated in a contest to develop their technological innovations unconstrained by the immediate consideration of the commercial potential of the innovations.\r\n      Eight teams competed as <a href=\"https://news.iu.edu/stories/2018/02/iub/releases/21-students-compete-in-cheng-wu-innovation-challenge.html\">finalists</a>, and Buddy the robot, which provides contextual speech therapy to children dealing with cleft\r\n      lip and palate, took home first place, earning $7,500 of the $15,000 total prize money. Small Donation-Big Impact, a donation system that could visually represent the impact of a donor’s contribution at an interactive kiosk, and Pulsar-based Terrestrial\r\n      Navigation, a new navigation system that uses radio signals from neutron stars, shared the second-place prize to earn $3,750 each.</p><br>\r\n    <p>The contest was judged by Brad Wisler, founder and CEO of Periodic, and co-founder and managing partner of SproutBox; Don Kuratko, Jack M. Gill Chair of Entrepreneurship, professor of entrepreneurship, and executive director of the Johnson Center\r\n      for Entrepreneurship &amp; Innovation, Kelley School of Business; and Dustin DuBois, partner at Ice Miller, as well as Shoemaker, Luddy, and Martin.</p><br>\r\n    <p>The fourth-floor Visualization Lab hosted the Vis Lab Showcase, where faculty and students presented data and scientific visualizations as well as augmented and virtual reality applications. From using 3D modeling to map the brain to using visualizations\r\n      in computer models to measure how different treatments might impact the fight against cancer, presentations showed the potential for bringing data to life through computing.</p><br>\r\n    <p>Day three of LuddyFest came to a dramatic conclusion after dark with the unveiling of Amatria, the custom sentient art installation from world-renowned architect Philip Beesley. Percussionists led a procession of students from the ground floor to\r\n      the top of Luddy Hall to light Amatria and officially dedicate the soon-to-be iconic piece of artwork.</p><br>\r\n    <p>Amatria was designed to interact and react to its environment, and it was installed with the help of Beesley’s team and a number of SICE volunteers.</p><br>\r\n    <p>Research steps into the spotlight Apr. 12 as Research Horizons opens. Held from 9 a.m.-5 p.m. in Dorsey Learning Hall, Research Horizons features TED-style lightning talks highlighting research being conducted at SICE, and it provides an opportunity\r\n      to meet our faculty, celebrate 50 years of computer science at IU, and explore the latest technologies and research developments in our school. High performance computing, security, and data science will be the focus of day one of the event.</p><br>\r\n    <p>Ian Rogers, the chief digital officer for LVMH and former senior director of Apple Music, will provide a keynote address at Research Horizons at 11 a.m. Rogers is a SICE alumnus in computer science.</p><br>\r\n    <p>From 12-2 p.m. in the Community Center (Room 1006), Professor of Informatics <a href=\"https://www.sice.indiana.edu/all-people/profile.html?profile_id=206\">Bernard Frischer</a> will host “What is Virtual Heritage and Why Does It Matter?” a talk focusing\r\n      on his research which will be followed by a demonstration by his students featuring augmented and virtual reality.

Now, decision-makers in higher education will be able to easily find out.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThanks to a grant from the National Science Foundation, Indiana University is developing an online service that will make it easier for university administrators to understand the importance of funding related to IT systems based at their institutions. The novel functionality will be available as a module for Open XDMoD (XD Metrics on Demand), which was developed by the University at Buffalo Center for Computational Research (CCR).<br><br>\r\n\r\nOpen XDMoD is an NSF-funded, open-source tool designed for the comprehensive management of cyberinfrastructure by providing a wide range of metrics and performance diagnostics for high performance computing (HPC) resources. A hosted version, known simply as XDMOD, was created specifically for <a href=\"https://www.xsede.org/\"> XSEDE</a> resources.<br><br>\r\n\r\nIU’s add-on module, called Open XDMoD Value Analytics (XDMoD-VA), will more precisely measure the impact of campus-based cyberinfrastructure through the tracking of grant outcomes and publication data.<br><br>\r\n\r\nSome details about the grant:<br><br>\r\n\r\n    NSF’s EAGER (EArly-concept Grants for Exploratory Research) award.\r\n    The award amount is nearly $300,000 and the funding duration is 18 months.\r\n    The Open XDMoD Value Analytics service is being developed by IU’s Research Technologies division, in conjunction with IU’s Cyberinfrastructure for Network Science Center (CNS) and the University at Buffalo’s CCR.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“Indiana University has been interested in documenting, describing, and understanding the value of cyberinfrastructure since 1991,” said Craig Stewart, IU associate dean, Research Technologies, and executive director, Pervasive Technology Institute. “This grant represents the continuation and deepening of two-and-a-half decades of work of ensuring that we’re making the best use of taxpayer money and university funds as we deploy cyberinfrastructure to the national research community.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nOpen XDMoD Value Analytics will allow university administrators to make informed decisions about funding campus-based cyberinfrastructure for their institutions by enabling a deeper understanding of how grants and publications are supported by local cyberinfrastructure.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“Ultimately, the real value of investing in campus cyberinfrastructure comes in knowing that it’s aiding and supporting our researchers,” said Matt Link, IU Research Technologies director of systems.<br><br>\r\n\r\nLink and IU Research Technologies colleague Robert Henschel, senior manager for the Scientific Applications and Performance Tuning team, collaborated with the CNS team led by Dr. Katy Börner, IU distinguished professor of information science, and Dr. Thomas Furlani, director of the University at Buffalo Center for Computational Research. <br><br>\r\n\r\n“We are excited to be working with the Indiana team to incorporate this capability into Open XDMoD,” said Furlani. “The addition of value analytics to Open XDMoD will greatly expand its utility to managers and administrators of advanced cyberinfrastructure by providing, for the first time, quantitative measures of return on investment together with a visual means of communicating return on investment.” <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe Open XDMoD Value Analytics module is being developed for institutions to install locally within an existing Open XDMoD installation to track grant outcomes and publications of their local researchers. <br><br>\r\n\r\nBörner and her team at CNS will develop novel methods to track, analyze and visualize publications by faculty, a primary method used to evaluate scholarly performance. <br><br>\r\n\r\n“Since its inception in 2003, XSEDE has provided 23 billion CPU hours to 4,845 principal investigators. More than 2,660 scientific publications cite XSEDE demonstrating its scholarly impact,” said Börner. “This project will develop data mining and visualization capabilities that support the detailed analysis and visual communication of XSEDE usage and its impact on scholarly productivity and collaboration in support of data-driven decision making by resource providers and consumers.”</p>"},

The more data you amass, the tougher it is to comprehend what you're dealing with.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nIn a push for better perspective, a group of information scientists in 2005 created a decade-long competitive art exhibit called Places & Spaces: Mapping Science. From artistic pop-culture plots to illustrations of the state of scientific collaboration (above), the founders hope winning entries inspire researchers to present their troves of data in clever and digestible ways.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n\"Good science maps give you a holistic understanding of how the data is structured,\" said information scientist Katy Börner of Indiana University, a founder and curator of the exhibit.

They can be ways to get global overviews on topics.\"\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThe exhibit's advisory board follows a theme and some core criteria to pick 10 winners each year. This year's winning entries for the theme \"science maps as visual interfaces to digital libraries\" were announced this week. Exhibit-ready versions of the maps are scheduled for display in mid-June.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nWe showcase some of our favorite winners here, in addition to a few that didn't make the final cut.

It’s perhaps fitting, then, that the film itself has been caught up in a similar momentum, with buzz about <em>Humanexus</em> and recognition for Shen building rapidly over the past year.\r\n<br/>\r\n<a href=\"/images/news/humanexus_poster.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"/images/news/humanexus_poster_th.jpg\" align=\"left\" style=\"margin:25px 20px 20px 0; height:300px;\"/></a>\r\n<br/>\r\nRecently, <em>Humanexus</em> was named an Official Selection of the 2013 Guam Film Festival, scheduled to take place September 24th through the 29th. This honor comes on the heels of the film’s nomination to the “Best Animation” category in the 2013 Taipei Film Festival. As an added bonus, the latter festival brought Shen’s work back to the artist’s own place of birth, as <em>Humanexus</em> received screenings in venues throughout Taipei during the festival’s three-week run. Then, in early August, the film was chosen for an Artistic Vision Award by the International Film Awards Berlin. Around the same time, it received an Award of Excellence from the Best Shorts Competition in La Jolla, California. Rounding off the list of honors, <em>Humanexus</em> has been named an Official Selection in New York’s Bootleg Film Festival, the Balinale International Film Festival, the Brownfish Short Film Festival, the Whitelight’s International Short Film Festival, the Roseville Animation Festival, the Uppsala International Short Film Festival, and the 2013 STUDIO 300 Digital Art and Music Festival. Such accolades serve as testimony to both the relevance of the film’s message and the artistic vision through which Shen conveys that message.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n<em>Humanexus</em> is the product of a close collaboration between Shen and Indiana University professor Katy Börner, an expert in the theory and practice of data mining and information visualization who suggested the initial story and provided guidance and resources along the way. And viewers of <em>Humanexus</em> will be struck by the evocative relationship between Shen’s visuals and the rich aural landscape created by composer and sound designer Norbert Herber, a senior lecturer in Indiana University’s Department of Telecommunications. The result of their efforts tracks the evolution of human communication from cave scrawls to Twitter feeds. And while the film captures the giddy exhilaration of discovery and creation, it also strikes darker notes as it imagines the crucial point at which humanity finds itself, a decisive moment that pivots between a path of continued creativity and innovation and one of information overload and message breakdown.   \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nUltimately, <em>Humanexus</em> argues that the question of “What kind of future do we want?” is one that each of us has the power to address.

But as the VIVO National Network (aka, Facebook for Scientists) moves along according to its 2-year timeline, the seven inaugural institutions in the pilot are busy loading their own data into the network. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nTo a programmer, the phrase &ldquo;just load the data&rdquo; is much akin to &ldquo;some assembly required&rdquo; for a parent on Christmas Eve. You just never know the exact tools you&rsquo;ll need to complete the job. With VIVO&rsquo;s basic infrastructure in place at the first institutions (University of Florida, Cornell University, Washington University&ndash;St. Louis, the Weill Cornell Medical College, Indiana University, the Scripps Research Institute, and the Ponce School of Medicine in Puerto Rico), funnel&shy; ing the data into the network was easier for some institutions than others.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nSmaller institutions such as the Scripps Research Institute and the Ponce School of Medicine are entering much of their data by hand, says Stephen V. Williams, VIVO&rsquo;s national site support and local IT support programmer. The staff members at the smaller institutions are pulling data from their respective human resources databases and then copying it into VIVO. &ldquo;But interestingly enough, since institutions like Indiana University, Cornell, and the University of Florida are all very large, we&rsquo;re very invested in auto&shy; mating ways to bring in our internal data,&rdquo; he says.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n<strong> Helping Ingest the Data </strong><br/><br/>\r\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m out in the field acting as the first implementer,&rdquo; says Williams, who has been helping participating institutions with their &ldquo;data ingest.&rdquo; In fact, he recently automated the input of 18,000 profiles into the VIVO system at the University of Florida (UF) that encompassed the faculty and the staff at the university. He also collected data from the grant research database and the institutional repository to add more authoritative content to the mix. The cleaner the data, the easier it is to move forward with the project and build on it.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nJon Corson-Rikert, the head of information technology services at Cornell University&rsquo;s Mann Library and VIVO creator, realized the importance of getting vetted data into the network from the start. &ldquo;We knew quite early on that we had to use institutional sources of data,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;and it just wouldn&rsquo;t be sustainable if we started to input all of the data manually or if we just copied and pasted other webpages into the network.&rdquo; So he reached out to several key players at Cornell, including the university human resources system called PeopleSoft (to export data about people and positions), the grants database (to find current grants, funding information, and patterns of funding research), and the courses database. &ldquo;Then we supplemented that data with an interactive interface where people could edit the information themselves to add new data or supplement it with updates on anything new such as international activity,&rdquo; he says.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nEvery institution is treated as a separate silo, according to Corson-Rikert. &ldquo;One of the tenets for the grant is that there has to be an institutional buy-in to the product,&rdquo; he says. Each institution is required to have its own local, sustainable version that doesn&rsquo;t require continual federal funding. The goal is to ensure local customization for any additional granularity and to eventually make the data available to a national network level for discovery.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nMuch of the brain power behind VIVO&rsquo;s development at Cornell was provided by Brian Caruso and Brian Lowe, programmers/developers who have been instrumental in helping Corson-Rikert transform VIVO from a people-finding service into a semantic web application. And their work continues as VIVO is enhanced and upgraded.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n<strong> Unlocking Hidden Data </strong><br/><br/>\r\nOne of the next items on the to-do list is creating a linked data compatibility for the VIVOnetwork. &ldquo;This is a way to expose the data within any VIVO profile so that it can become part of the semantic web as a larger and more seamless way to get data visible from one application to another on the web,&rdquo; says Corson-Rikert. Much of what the VIVO National Network is trying to do is to unlock this institutional data that has long been hidden in silos. Once the data has been unlocked, it can be available on a consistent platform at the universities and then ultimately to a broader audience so that the world can access this authoritative data. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nAnd there have been more than a few surprises along the way. Although the team initially figured that accessing institutional data would be easy, that hasn&rsquo;t always been the case. In theory, the data would always be available in one place, where it could be found easily and pulled into the database. Plus, not all institutions can provide a coherent map of their organizational structure, so sometimes there&rsquo;s no database that explains intradepartmental ties, according to Williams. &ldquo;The financial data tells you where the money goes,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;but we don&rsquo;t always see the lines connecting the reporting process. A couple of institutions actually had to draw in those dotted lines that just don&rsquo;t show up on [the] financial database.&rdquo;\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nOne of the challenges that universities face is that they are meeting so many compliance requirements and regulations, says Corson-Rikert. &ldquo;Their systems must be driven by what they must do,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Institutions don&rsquo;t always get a chance to develop things that are academically useful for the school and for communicating who they are to the outside world,&rdquo; he says. Obviously, much work goes into creating the schools&rsquo; webpages, which are chiefly designed for student recruitment or marketing purposes. &ldquo;But some of the feedback we&rsquo;ve received about VIVO is that academics like to see something that is obviously meant for the exchange of information about what people are doing in their academic lives, their teaching, their research, their interests, and it doesn&rsquo;t require any understanding of the administrative portion of the university to approach it or navigate it.&rdquo; \r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nCorson-Rikert sees plenty of questions on the road ahead in terms of scalability and how other people will ultimately use VIVO. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re very open to that,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;With the semantic web, we want to make sure the data is in a very standard format so users can exchange structured data. There are lots of other tools that work with that data too. So we&rsquo;re not locked into one solution.&rdquo; The collaboration among the universities in the pilot stage may have been slow at first, according to Williams, &ldquo;but thatthe way projects tend to go. Everyone is just testing the waters.&rdquo; Now people are getting more comfortable talking about problems with the ontologies or with the data in conference calls or wikis.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nSo far, the team is quite encouraged with the progress of the pilot project. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s gratifying to see schools being able to load data in and essentially do real work with it,&rdquo; says Corson-Rikert. The word is already spreading across the globe. The University of Melbourne in Australia has adopted VIVO as part of its work on developing a template application for the Australian national data register. Likewise, China has three installations of VIVO hosted by the Chinese Academy of Sciences as disciplinary research portals for biodiversity, evolutionary biology, and biomedicine and health across 28 member institutions.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n&ldquo;We&rsquo;re doing a lot of work on the infrastructure, improving the way the software was built, putting in documentation, and putting in safeguards to tell us when links have broken,&rdquo; says Corson-Rikert. &ldquo;This lays a solid foundation for us, so that as the VIVO National Network expands, we&rsquo;ll have a good handle on what is going on.&rdquo;"},

The October event marked a fascinating symbiosis of content and medium, with the visionary maps that make up Places & Spaces providing a perfect complement to the stunning visual experience of the iPearl Immersion Theater. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nAccording to Mike Nutt, Digital Media Librarian at North Carolina State University and one of the coordinators of the exhibit, the maps were quite well received.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n\"The goal of the iPearl Immersion Theater is to create experiences that change the way our visitors see the world. Few of our exhibits have captivated our patrons like <em>Places & Spaces</em>. One visitor to the exhibit said, 'I have never seen anything like it before.'\"<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nNow in its ninth year, the <em>Places & Spaces</em> exhibit has traced the evolution of science maps, featuring the most powerful examples of knowledge domain mapping, novel location-based cartographies, data visualizations, and science-inspired art works. Created by leading figures in the natural, physical, and social sciences, scientometrics, visual arts, social and science policymaking, and the humanities, the maps in <em>Places & Spaces</em> allow us to better grasp the abstract contexts, relationships, and dynamism of human systems and collective intelligence. Individually and as a whole, the maps of <em>Places & Spaces</em> allow data to tell stories which both the scientist and the layperson can understand and appreciate.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nOver the course of its nine-year existence, these maps have adorned the walls of some of the most prestigious libraries, museums, and universities around the world (see <a href=\"http://www.scimaps.org/exhibitions\" target=\"_blank\">scimaps.org/exhibitions</a> for a complete listing of venues). By presenting the mapping of science in the context of a more traditional exhibit-going experience, <em>Places & Spaces</em> has brought together two cultural locations—the lab and the gallery—that have often been viewed as ideologically and aesthetically remote. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nIn keeping, however, with the exhibit’s commitment to both tracing science mapping’s past and offering glimpses of its future, <em>Places & Spaces</em> partnered with North Carolina State University’s innovative Hunt Library and its state-of-the-art iPearl Immersion Theater to offer a new way to experience this important collection. With its 7x16-foot Christie® MicroTiles® digital display, the iPearl Immersion Theater surrounds viewers with larger-than-life maps of science that are visually arresting from afar and amazingly sharp up close. With media outlets like <em>Time</em> magazine, <em>Ploughshares</em>, <em>Architect</em> magazine, and others placing it at the forefront of a renaissance in library design and capabilities, the Hunt Library was the perfect cutting-edge venue to feature the groundbreaking work of <em>Places & Spaces: Mapping Science</em>.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nSaid Nutt, \"These incredible visualizations literally stopped people in their tracks. After an initial moment of awe and wonder, people invariably moved in closer to examine the details of the maps. The Hunt Library doesn't have book stacks to browse, so we depend on exhibits like <em>Places & Spaces</em> to provide that kind of serendipitous knowledge discovery. I believe it has set a new benchmark for our video wall content program.\"<br/><br/>\r\n\r\niPearl Immersion Theater: <a href=\"http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/spaces/ipearl-immersion-theater \" target=\"_blank\">lib.ncsu.edu/spaces/ipearl-immersion-theater</a><br/>\r\nNorth Carolina State University’s Hunt Library: <a href=\"http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/huntlibrary\" target=\"_blank\">lib.ncsu.edu/huntlibrary</a>"},

Yngve Professor of Information Science at IU Bloomington's School of Library and Information Science, sits on a panel with Sir Tim Berners-Lee, founder of the World Wide Web and the current director of the WWW Foundation. The topic, \"The Global Design Challenge,\" is a session designed to provide insights on the growing importance of design and to share ideas on how it can foster change in addressing a range of global issues.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\"My perspective is most relevant for understanding and managing complexity using data mining and visualization,\" she said of the panel session that also includes Eben Bayer, the founder of Ecovative Design, and Zhang Xin, CEO and co-founder of SOHO China. The panel is chaired by Paola Antonelli, director of research and development at The Museum of Modern Art, New York.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nOn Thursday, Jan. 24, Börner gives a 45-minute talk titled \"Visualizing What We Know,\" while using the World Economic Forum's Davos BetaZone, a studio room that uses new technology to visualize innovations at the annual meeting on a nearly 24-square-meter display wall.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nFinally, on Saturday, Jan. 26, she participates on a second panel discussion, this one on the topic \"Reinforcing Critical Infrastructure With Cyber Experts.\" The panel includes technology leaders from the Georgia Institute of Technology, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Carnegie Mellon University. Börner will speak specifically on the topic, \"Dangerous Visualizations: Big Data Is Watching You.\"\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nBörner said \"Big Data\" is the new definitive source of competitive advantage across all industries, yet also the raw material for fraud, identity theft and a generation of dangerous visualizations that could reveal sensitive information impacting an entity's reputation and security. As \"Big Data\" is exposed, interlinked, mined and visualized for broader consumption, it will be important to have norms and policies in place that ensure high data quality, best analysis and visualization workflows, and continuous improvement of legal regulations.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\"The key takeaways for the presentation will be that 'Big Data' also means big trouble, that advanced data mining and visualization tools can help prevent abuse, and that proper norms, policies and legal regulations are key,\" she said.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nBörner said she was invited to participate at the World Economic Forum after being recommended by a peer, and that she welcomed the opportunity to continue her efforts at informing how insightful information visualizations can aid a variety of users, from elementary-age school children to the CEOs of the world's largest corporations.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\"The WEF is unique in that it brings together academic, business, political and other leaders of society to discuss and shape regional and global agendas in science and industry,\" she said. \"Over the last 10 years, we have worked closely with researchers, companies and science policy makers to develop data mining and visualization tools that help improve daily decision-making. I am looking forward to introducing our plug-and-play <a href=\"http://cishell.org/\" target=\"_blank\">macroscope tools</a>, visualizations from the <a href=\"http://scimaps.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Mapping Science</a> exhibit and the information visualization MOOC to an even broader audience.\"\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe World Economic Forum annual meeting is a five-day, invitation-only annual event that brings together some 2,500 top business leaders, international political leaders, selected intellectuals and journalists to discuss the most pressing issues facing the world, including health and the environment.

This service is free and available to students worldwide.  \r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n“We’re trying to make learning really exciting,” Jafari said. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nIn addition to research presentation, the open house provided information on the Information Visualization MOOC course, the first of which was launched January 2013. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThis graduate-level class provides a foundation on the art of information visualization.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThe first course had 1,780 students enrolled from 93 different countries. Most of the students were from the United States, India, Canada, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nLecturer Scott Weingart will teach the spring 2014 course.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nFor this coming semester, there are some proposed extensions to the course material, including information visualization for the digital humanities and statistics. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nGabriel Zhou, a Ph.D student in Computer Sciences, said he attended the event because he wanted to see his colleagues and hear Börner speak. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n“I’m also doing info-based research so the demos were beneficial to my own research,” Zhou said. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nAfter the presentations, members of the audience mingled with the speakers.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n“Ultimately, I believe anyone can make sense of data,” Börner said.  “Just like anyone can cook, anyone can map and visualize data and make sense of it.”\r\n<br/><br/>"},

This funding is underpinned by an enormous collection of data, which for the first time this week has been brought to life in a new way as a result of a competition held by the <a href=\"http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/home/home.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/Pages/Home.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC)</a> and the http://www.bl.uk British Library.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe competition, Visualising Research, challenged entrants to create a new visualisation of the UK Research Council funding data, which makes use of the online database ‘Gateway to Research’, and which tells a compelling story that anyone could understand. The two winning entrants were a professional agency ÜberResearch, and a collaboration between four infographic enthusiasts in Sheffield. Their win was announced at the British Library last night, as part of an event to mark the Library’s ongoing exhibition about data visualisation, Beautiful Science.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe winning entry in the professional category was created by ÜberResearch, who have created a data map showing the overall distribution of funds across topics, using bubble, placement and colour effects to give more detail on the distribution. It also applies this same technique to the portfolios of different research institutions and universities, revealing their unique preferences, priorities and gaps. Their entry can be viewed in full online <a href=\"http://clients.stefaner.eu/uberresearch/uk/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn the non-professional category, the winning entry, created by ‘Three Men and a Stato’ and entitled ‘Feeding the Public Mind’, shows an infographic which they describe as ‘like looking out from the viewing platform of a skyscraper’. Using the model of a brain, the four team members have displayed the whole breadth and depth of the funding picture, and then encourage users to ‘peer through the telescope’ to see the details of specific areas. You can view their entry in full online here.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe judges of the competition included: Professor Jackie Hunter, Chief Executive of BBSRC, Professor Mark Llewellyn, Director of Research at AHRC, Professor Katy Börner, Victor H.

Open data, open tools, and open education make it possible for anyone to render data into insights, knowledge, and more informed decisions.”\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nLee-Ann Coleman, Head of Science, Technology and Medicine at the British Library, said: “The British Library is committed to making information easily accessible through its own work supporting researchers, and so we’re delighted to be part of this competition, which is all about how you can communicate complex data and ideas in an innovative way.

Through this partnership, the Mapping Science team hopes to reimagine the traditional exhibit-going experience, making available to viewers a greater amount of information and a higher level of interactivity than ever before.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nDescribed as an “exhibit space for works of high artistic, experimental, or educational merit” by the library’s Data Visualization Coordinator Angela Zoss, the LINK MediaWall is an 18-panel tiled wall display equipped with both directional speakers and network cameras that will allow audiences to engage with the exhibit’s maps of science in dynamic ways. \r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe plan for the 9th iteration display is to begin with a basic rotating digital presentation of the ten maps. From there, however, users would be able to freeze on a particular map or navigate to another in the rotation. Once a particular map was selected, users could then pan across the map or zoom in on particular details for closer inspection. Going further, visitors to the MediaWall would also be able to access web versions of the maps, additional production and background information, and even interviews with the mapmakers about their work.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nWorking closely with Zoss and Todd Berreth (research scientist and programmer for Art, Art History, and Visual Studies at Duke), the <em>Places & Spaces</em> exhibit hopes to create a more dynamic relationship between the maps and their audience—a relationship that involves not only information, but also curiosity, play, and discovery."},

Doctoral candidate Angela Zoss, MIS student Trevor Edelblute, and postdoctoral researcher Inna Kouper (Ph.D.’11) were awarded one of only two Best Student Entries for their data visualization project titled, ‘Diseases across the Top Five Languages of the PubMed Database: 1961 – 2012.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe IU-led team focused their visualization project on diseases in the biomedical literature in English, French, German, Japanese and Russian between 1961 and 2012. Using a database maintained by the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), they mapped and visualized the titles of articles retrieved from the MEDLINE/PubMed database.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe initial dataset, compiled from the Scholarly Database hosted by the Cyberinfrastructure for Network Science Center in the IU Department of Information and Library Science, contained over 21,000,000 records and covered a time period between 1809 and 2013. After correcting erroneous or incomplete entries and noting a sparseness of publications during certain date ranges and languages, the team narrowed their sample to articles that were published in the top five languages between 1961 and 2012. They then developed a classifier to match publication titles to a comprehensive disease classification system, which resulted in 4.24 million publications being classified into nine broad disease categories.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe visualization combines large alluvial diagrams, which show distributions of publications in the top five languages over disease categories, and small streamgraphs, which show trends in publications for each disease category across the five languages.

The two-day event is funded by the National Science Foundation’s Science of Science and Innovation Policy program, the Cyberinfrastructure for Network Science Center, the IU Network Science Institute and industry.</p></br>\r\n<p>The event is organized by <a title=\"This link opens in a new tab or window.\" href=\"https://www.ils.indiana.edu/people/profile.html?profile_id=2\" target=\"_blank\">Katy Börner</a> and <a title=\"This link opens in a new tab or window.\" href=\"https://www.ils.indiana.edu/people/profile.html?profile_id=86\" target=\"_blank\">Staša Milojević</a> of the IU School of Informatics and Computing's Department of Information and Library Science and the IU Network Science Institute.&nbsp;<span>The welcome and opening remarks will be presented by C.D. \"Dan\" Mote Jr., president of the National Academy of Engineering.</span></p></br>\r\n<p>The conference also features presentations by high-profile science policy makers from government, academia and industry, including representatives from the National Institutes of Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, European Agency of Technology and Innovation Assessment, Harvard and Stanford universities, and PayPal.</p></br>\r\n<p>\"One of the biggest challenges in science policy is the ability to effectively allocate resources -- both financial and human -- in ways that foster innovation,\" said Börner, IU's Victor H. Yngve Distinguished Professor of Information Science. \"The vast amount of data now available on science and technology, combined with remarkable growth in computing power, create ideal conditions for using computer modeling to not only understand but also predict probable future directions in science, technology and innovation.\"</p></br>\r\n<p>Computational models of science, technology and innovation are used in many areas of academic research, including information science and computing, economics and the social sciences. Examples of computational models that currently benefit society are meteorological forecasts to predict weather and storms; epidemiological models to predict and prevent pandemics; and climate models to predict future scenarios and set carbon prices.</p></br>\r\n<p>Companies such as Netflix and Amazon regularly use advanced data mining, modeling and visualization algorithms to advance their goals, Börner added, yet government and academia have been slower to employ these tools to improve human decision-making.</p></br>\r\n<p>Other roles that data models could play in science policy include the creation of \"policy flight simulators\" that empower decision-makers to test-run likely future scenarios before supporting specific projects; <a title=\"This link opens in a new tab or window.\" href=\"\" target=\"_blank\">\"science forecasts\"</a> that communicate local and global news in science, technology and innovation to a general audience; and a \"<a title=\"This link opens in a new tab or window.\" href=\"http://modsti.cns.iu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Data-Driven-Science-Policy.pdf\">FundRank model</a>\" to award research dollars based on expert crowdsourcing versus the traditional grant proposal review process.</p></br>\r\n<p>This concept, inspired by the “PageRank” technology that powers Google, has been proposed by IU associate professor Johan Bollen, Börner and colleagues at IU. The \"policy flight simulator\" concept has been implemented by scientists at the Stevens Institute of Technology.</p></br>\r\n<p>IU presenters at the conference include Santo Fortunato, professor in the School of Informatics and Computing; Timothy Slaper, director of economic analysis at the IU Kelley School of Business' Indiana Business Research Center; and Xiaoran Yan, a research scientist at the <a title=\"This link opens in a new tab or window.\" href=\"http://iuni.iu.edu/\">IU Network Science Institute</a>.</p></br>\r\n<p>Börner and Milojević will each moderate a panel discussion and deliver opening and closing remarks, respectively.

Daniel O’Donnell, project manager for the <a title=\"This link opens in a new tab or window.\" href=\"http://cns.iu.edu/\">Cyberinfrastructure for Network Science Center</a>, will attend as the local organizer of conference activities.</p></br>\r\n<p>\"Computational and statistical modeling will become increasingly important to science policy, since we need to understand the principles that govern the practice of science to maximize its benefits to society,\" said Milojević, IU associate professor of information and library science, whose own research involves creating models of how teams emerge and grow. \"I'm excited about this conference, which will bring together leading experts in the modeling of science. We hope to help bridge the gap between academic, interdisciplinary research and real-world decision-making by policy-makers and funding agencies.\"</p></br>\r\n<p>In addition to the NSF-funded conference, Börner recently played a role at another major conference on big data and science policy, presenting at the <a title=\"This link opens in a new tab or window.\" href=\"http://icss.ist.psu.edu/\">International Symposium on Science of Science at the Library of Congress</a> in March.

But Bollen, a computer scientist at Indiana University, Bloomington, would simply award all eligible researchers a block grant—and then require them to give some of it away to colleagues they judge most deserving.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThat radical step, described in a paper Bollen and four Indiana colleagues recently posted on EMBO Reports, retains peer review's core concept of tapping into the views of the most knowledgeable researchers. But it would eliminate the huge investment in time and money required to submit proposals and assemble panels to judge them.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nBollen's process would be almost instantaneous: In a version of expert-directed crowdsourcing, scientists would fill out a form once a year listing their favored researchers, and a predetermined portion of their annual grant money—a total of, say, 50%—would then be transferred to their choices.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n\"So many scientists spend so much time on peer review, and there's a high level of frustration,\" Bollen explains. \"We already know who the best people are. And if you're doing good work, then you deserve to receive support.\"\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nOthers are skeptical. \"I've known Johan for a long time and have the highest regard for his ability as an out-of-the-box thinker,\" says Stephen Griffin, a retired National Science Foundation (NSF) program manager who's now a visiting professor of information sciences at the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. \"But there are a number of issues he doesn't address.\"\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThose sticking points include the likely mismatch between what researchers need and what their colleagues give them; the absence of any replacement for the overhead payments in today's grants, which support infrastructure at host institutions; and the dearth of public accountability for the billions of dollars that would flow from public coffers to individuals. \"Scientists aren't really equipped to be a funding agency,\" Griffin notes.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nBollen acknowledges that the process would need safeguards to ensure that scientists don't reward their friends or punish their enemies. But his analysis suggests that the U.S. research landscape would not look all that different if his radical proposal were adopted.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nDrawing upon citation data in 37 million papers over 20 years, the Indiana researchers conducted a simulation premised on the idea that scientists would reallocate their federal dollars according to how often they cited their peers. The simulation, he says, yielded a funding pattern \"similar in shape to the actual distribution\" at NSF and the National Institutes of Health for the past decade—at a fraction of the overhead required by the current system."},

You'll get all this and more with the Information Visualization Massively Open Online Course (IVMOOC), offered by the <a href=\"http://cns.iu.edu\" target=\"_blank\">Cyberinfrastructure for Network Science (CNS) Center</a> at the School of Informatics and Computing, Indiana University.\r\n<br/><br/> \r\nIn its second year, the IVMOOC will run from January 28 to April 14, 2014. The course provides an overview about the state of the art in information visualization, and teaches the process of producing effective visualizations that take the needs of users into account. The target audience is graduate students able to work three to six hours per week. Students will learn basic concepts, practical skills, and team project development. Everybody who registers gains instant free access to the <a href=\"http://sdb.cns.iu.edu\" target=\"_blank\">Scholarly Database</a> (26 million paper, patent and grant records) and the <a href=\"http://sci2.cns.iu.edu\" target=\"_blank\">Sci2 Tool</a> (180+ algorithms and tools). \r\n<br/><br/> \r\nInformation visualization continues to broaden its reach from computer science and human-computer interaction into fields like drug discovery, financial analysis and scientific research. The IVMOOC is one of the first MOOCs offered by IU and the first to offer an opportunity for students to work in teams with actual clients, like researchers interested in understanding data patterns and trends, government agencies developing visual interfaces for data holdings, industry representatives looking to maximize return on investment, medical doctors seeking cures, and not-for-profit organizations hoping to communicate impacts and achievements.\r\n<br/><br/> \r\n \r\nSince the launch of the first IVMOOC, Katy Börner and David E. Polley have written a companion textbook, <a href=\"http://cns.iu.edu/ivmoocbook14.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Visual Insights: A Practical Guide to Making Sense of Data</em></a>, that offers a gentle introduction to the design of insightful visualizations. It seamlessly blends theory and practice, giving readers both the theoretical foundation and the practical skills necessary to render data into insights. The book is recommended reading for IVMOOC 2014. The book can be purchased from <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Visual-Insights-Practical-Guide-Making/dp/0262526190/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1384193730&sr=8-1&keywords=visual+insights+a+practical+guide\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/visual-insights-katy-b-rner/1117270498?ean=9780262526197\" target=\"_blank\">Barnes & Noble</a>, or <a href=\"http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/visual-insights\" target=\"_blank\">MIT Press</a>.\r\n<br/><br/> \r\n \r\nThis year, the course can be taken for three Indiana University credits as part of the <a href=\"http://news.iu.edu/releases/iu/2013/11/data-science-program-soic.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">Online Data Science Program</a> just announced by the School of Informatics and Computing.

At each table a pair of scientists and/or social scientists sat across from each other, talking for five minutes until the buzzer rang with a one-minute warning. Then, it was time to move on to the next pairing and eight more rounds of speed-networking.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe Jan. 23 gathering at the Social Science Research Commons in Woodburn Hall was the second of three speed-networking events organized by Meryl Bertenthal and her team at the Office of the Vice Provost for Research in collaboration with Professor Peter Todd and graduate student Samantha Cohen, both in the Department of Psychology and Brain Sciences. The events, funded by OVPR, are part of an ongoing study on the formation of academic partnerships and the best ways to ignite them.<br><br>\r\n\r\nHalf of the 25 participating faculty members were affiliated with the newly formed IU Network Science Institute, including co-director Bernice Pescosolido and institute leadership team member Katy Börner. Others, like SPEA professor Matthew Baggetta, saw network theory as potentially useful to their work.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe idea for the project began with the task entrusted to Bertenthal and her team: to build collaborations on campus and find strategies that bring researchers from different fields together. Bertenthal learned that cognitive scientist Peter Todd had run a series of speed-dating events as part of his research on how people choose their mates and his interests extended to how other kinds of human partnerships form as well. Discussions led to the current project: A two-year speed-networking study.<br><br>\r\n\r\nFor Cohen, the project is satisfying as a study in social psychology- on how people choose their partners. But as an academic, she said she has a personal stake in the process, in finding out \"how to optimize potential collaborations.\"<br><br>\r\n\r\nTodd explained that they attempt to increase the likelihood of fostering productive collaborations by considering different ways of pairing people: complementary vs. matching interests, varying degrees of similarity between interests and random pairings. Some of the algorithms used by online dating companies work better than the random pairings of a speed-dating event, Todd suggested. But the researchers have yet to complete the study and draw their conclusions.<br><br>\r\n\r\nTo optimize collaboration even further, OVPR is offering $10,000 to fund up to five projects between people who initially meet and form partnerships at the event. The first speed-networking event, a slightly larger event on the topic of behavior and health, yielded six funded proposals funded by the Office of the Vice Provost for Research. One of those proposals was the first in a series of collaborative research that Psychological and Brain Sciences professor Josh Brown began with Professor Jon Macy in the School of Public Health. The two recently submitted a proposal to study drug usage in the fMRI scanner and have ideas for future projects as well.<br><br>\r\n\r\n\"I've met people here I never would have met,\" says SPEA professor Diane Henshel. Midway through the event, she had already found at least three people she was planning to see again and one with whom she hopes to collaborate at a later stage of her current cybersecurity research. Henshel said this was a far more productive way to meet future research partners \"than attending a 20-person panel.\"<br><br>\r\n\r\nOf the six people that library and information science professor Stasa Milojevic met, she was already planning to meet with five. \"I really had fun,\" says Milojevic, who studies the formation of scientific teams and fields using statistical and computational modeling.\r\nJustin Garcia, a behavioral biologist at The Kinsey Institute who studies the evolution of monogamy, was excited to have met social psychologist Eliot Smith. The two had never met, though each knew of the other and had various connections and complementary interests. Smith himself noted, \"Justin is focused on couples. We don't have anyone in social psychology who studies couples.\"<br><br>\r\n\r\nWith the biology and culture of relationships on one hand and social psychology on the other, \"Together we'd make a good sandwich,\" Garcia added.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<h3>Learn more about Peter Todd's work on mate choice</h3>\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sPndPqXC5q0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen aria-label=\"youtube\"></iframe>"},

Using data provided by the Indy Big Data Conference 2017 Visualization Challenge and data from STATS, the U.S. Census, and other sources, the group created graphics illustrating the increase in drug poisoning deaths from 1999-2014, the reasons for the drug poisoning deaths, the number of drug deaths in the United States compared to the state of Indiana, the location of substance abuse facilities, and the ratio of opioid prescriptions to drug-related deaths.</p><br>\r\n\r\n<p>Poojary presented the visualizations at the conference through a slideshow titled “<em><a href=\"http://cns.iu.edu/docs/presentations/2017-CNS-Opioid-Vis-Challenge.pdf\">Reproducible Visual Analytics of Public Opioid Data</a></em>.”</p><br>\r\n\r\n<p>“This project was an opportunity for us to understand an issue which has effected thousands of families in the state of Indiana and the country,” Poojary said. “It allowed me to apply the skills I have developed in my coursework at SICE and while working at CNS, and we hope our visualizations will give the diverse decision makers actionable insights for addressing the opioid epidemic.”</p><br>\r\n\r\n<p>The information gleaned from the Visualization Challenge will be critical going forward in the wake of legislation passed by the Indiana General Assembly earlier this year. House Bill 1470, also known as the Open Data Bill, codifies the open sharing of information between agencies and promotes the use of data to guide policy.</p><br>\r\n\r\n<p>“Data-driven decision making allows us to make better-informed policy decisions and improve services and programs,” said Darshan Shah, chief data officer of the state of Indiana and the executive director of the state’s Management Performance Hub. “But, more importantly, we have to continue to make sure we are efficient with our resources while driving better policy decisions and improved services and programs.”</p><br>\r\n\r\n<p>Poojary also had the opportunity to speak to Jim McClelland, the Indiana executive director for drug treatment, prevention and enforcement, and the CNS will continue its collaboration with state officials on ways to present information about the opioid epidemic.</p><br>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information on the CNS, visit the center’s <a href=\"http://cns.iu.edu/\">website</a>.</p>"},

The first story displays a zoomable, rotatable 3-D model of Amatria to help visitors locate and understand its technical aspects, such as sensors, speakers and microprocessors.</p><br>\r\n    <p>The second story depicts how two of Amatria’s 18 infrared sensors respond to movement in its surroundings in real time.</p><br>\r\n    <p>These sensors, distributed in six pods of small, low-hanging black boxes around the sculpture, measure distances to foreign objects and generate reactive lights, sounds and vibrations nearby.</p><br>\r\n    <p>Amatria’s constant shifts and noises cause many passers-by to slow their tracks, heads craned upward and mouths gaped open, as they emerge from the stairwell beneath it.</p><br>\r\n    <figure style=\"margin: 10px 0;\">\r\n      <img src=\"/images/news/20180425_amatria-details.jpg\" style=\"width: 100%;\">\r\n      <figcaption class=\"embedded-caption\" style=\"text-align:left;\">\r\n        \"Amatria\" contains spheres depicting hollow bone structures of birds and mammals.

During this initial visit, the goal was to get more insight into the actual content of the so-called LOD Laundromat through analyzing and visualizing the data, as well as exploring collaboration synergies between IU and the VU.<br>\r\nIt was a busy and interesting week, with a presentation from an artist creating a sculpture about the fields of science (<a href=\"http://cns.iu.edu/netscitalks.html\">http://cns.iu.edu/netscitalks.html</a>), meetings with people specialized in governance, the semantic web, data visualization and provenance, and the official opening of the Indiana University Network Science Institute. It lead to novel ideas and insights, a summary of which can be found below:<br><br>\r\n– Visualizing LOD Laundromat: there are two main ideas for visualizing the LOD gathered through the LOD Laundromat. The first one is to create a bipartite network based on vocabularies/ontologies (e.g., VIVO ontology) used and the datasets that use them. This would help identify dominant and alternative ontologies. Edges will be based on if ontologies are used in the datasets. Ontologies/Namespaces can have a threshold of being used more than once (reused). Metadata can be the number of classes, properties etc. The datasets would have a threshold of 100 or a 1000 triples, depending on the results. We can also filter based on how many entities are in the datasets, but the meaning of entities is ambiguous and should be determined first then. All metadata from the datasets can be used to be variables to determine e.g. size or color.<br>\r\nThe second visualization is thinking about levels of abstraction to create a LOD graph of graphs (there are 600.000 datasets that could be somehow connected to one large graph). This however is a larger challenge, where more conceptual choices need to be made first.<br>\r\n– Issues with accessing content: the VU is specialized in crawling and cleaning the data, a challenging and important process needed for using LOD on a larger scale. However, the next step is thinking about LOD content and its usage. Because of the focus on cleaning and publishing, the means of accessing the LOD Laundromat data are not user friendly. The website only provides SPARQL options for metadata about the cleaning. There is however no metadata about the actual datasets; who provided it, or when and how often the data was used. The tool provided to query for documents with certain characteristics (‘Frank’) is written in bash and therefore not usable on Windows machines. Even after getting ‘Frank’ running, e.g., using a virtual machine, the tool is not user friendly for laymen since it is a middleware tool.\r\n– Collaboration between VU and IU: it was an inspiring and interesting exchange of data, tools, and expertise, and IU and VU partners look forward to continue the collaboration on this and related projects.\r\n<br>\r\nTo summarize, both challenges and opportunities for visualizations of the LOD Laundromat were established, which can further accommodate the process of visualization. Continued collaboration between IU and VU can help overcome the difficulties to get great visualizations as a result.</p>"},

It is designed to be an open and unconstrained discussion on evidence gaps in science and innovation, and on initiatives the international community can take to address data needs in this area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Börner presented in a panel that discussed new models and tools for measuring the impact of science and innovation. She presented a paper titled “Modelling Science, Technology, and Innovation” that she co-authored with associate professor of informatics <a href=\"https://www.soic.indiana.edu/all-people/profile.html?profile_id=86\">Staša Milojevic</a>.</p><br>\r\n\r\n<p>“Computational models should be more widely used in STI studies and practice as they help make assumptions explicit, describe the structure and dynamics of systems, communicate and explain systems, suggest possible interventions, and identify new questions,” Börner said.</p><br>\r\n\r\n<p>Other members of the panel were Adam Jaffe from Motu Economic and Public Policy Research in New Zealand, Koen Debackere from KU Leuven in Belgium, and Giovanni Dosi from Scuola Superiore Sant’Anna in Italy.</p><br>\r\n\r\n<p>Börner also served as a moderator on a panel focusing on data analytics for science and innovation, which included a discussion of a paper on “High-Impact and Transformative (HITS) Metrics” co-authored with Bruce Weinberg and Joseph Staudt, Ohio, State U, Jerry Marschke and Huifeng Yu, SUNY Albany, and Robert Light, Senior Systems Analyst at IU’s <a href=\"http://cns.iu.edu/\">Cyberinfrastructure for Network Science Center</a> (CNS).</p><br>\r\n\r\n<p>Interactive data visualizations from the <a href=\"http://scimaps.org/\">Mapping Science</a> exhibit—which Börner and Lisel Record, CNS curate—were on display at Blue Sky, empowering many to interact with science and technology data in new ways.

Well-designed data visualizations can help bridge knowledge, language, and cultural differences.\"</p><br>\r\n\r\n<p>Sugimoto was part of a panel titled “Towards more inclusive science and innovation indicators,” which addressed the broad perception that robust theories and measures that map the ways in which societies seek and adopt novel ideas to address their major challenges are lacking. Sugimoto was joined by Ismael Rafols of the Universitat Politècnica de Valencia in Spain, Eric von Hippel, from the MIT Sloan School of Management, and Ingeborg Meijer of Leiden University in the Netherlands.</p><br>\r\n\r\n<p>“The conference provided an unparalleled opportunity to discuss the system of scientific evaluation with a variety of stakeholders, including representatives from the OECD, academic faculty and administrators, and policy makers and ministers from across the globe,” Sugimoto said.</p><br>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr.Vincent Larivière, part of Sugimoto’s collaboration with the Université de Montréal, presented their work on gender in science in a parallel session while Sugimoto presented a paper on scientific mobility in a panel titled “Researchers on the move.”</p><br>\r\n\r\n<p>“My research—on social media metrics, gender, and scientific mobility—all examine ways in which the current evaluation system provides diversity of voice in terms of the construction of, access to, and reward for scientific work,” Sugimoto said. “It’s an honor and delight to be able to share my research with a community that is empowered to make changes to improve the way science is monitored and rewarded.”</p><br>"},
