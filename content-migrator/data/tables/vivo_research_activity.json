Topping the list of offenders is lung cancer, a disease which is preventable. <br />\nThis scientometric study aims to evaluate and compare investigator initiated R01-research and Transdisciplinary Tobacco Use Research Centers (TTURC) funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) between 1999 and 2009. The study results comprise a geospatial and topical analysis, a network analysis of collaboration networks, an $-input vs. publications-output analysis, and a temporal analysis of data trends and coverage. Results were interpreted by tobacco domain experts providing insight into the overall structure and evolution of tobacco research collaborations, interdisciplinary integration, and impact on science as a whole. <br /><br />\nEvaluating Large, Interdisciplinary Research Initiatives, NIH/NCI Contract.
