Its users could collaboratively examine, discuss, and modify (add/delete resources, annotate) documents, thereby converting this document space into an ever-evolving repository of the user community's collective knowledge that members can access, learn from, contribute to, and build upon. The space became a shared 'Memory Palace' representing a common understanding of different theories by the community. The iGarden - officially 'Mirror Garden' - world visualized user interaction data such as navigation, manipulation, chatting, and Web access activity.
